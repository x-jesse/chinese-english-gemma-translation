1
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,160
现在我明白了
I see it now.

2
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,370
我不能让你走
I can't let you leave.

3
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,160
那就只能说声抱歉了
I'm sorry you feel that way.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,290
该我说才对
I'm sorry too.

5
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,700
可怜的萨罗
Poor Salo.

6
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,080
那个不是杰斯
That isn't Jayce.

7
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,160
他在被另一个心智左右
But there is another will at work within him.

8
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,000
我隐隐约约 在入口关闭前听到了些什么
I thought I heard something just before the portal closed.

9
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,580
很古老 像是...
Ancient, like a...

10
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,160
像是有人在说话
Like a voice.

11
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,660
那个其实是一种非常高深的咒语
This is a sophisticated conjuration.

12
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:44,870
它是独一无二的 同时具备了 自我复制和自我湮灭的特质
A singularity, simultaneously self-replicating and self-annihilating.

13
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,700
我们从未遇过这么错综复杂的情况
We've never seen complexity like this.

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,500
形态完美
Flawless...

15
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,580
运转精妙
exquisite...

16
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,580
状态混沌
chaos.

17
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,370
? I wake up to the sounds Of the silence that allows ?

18
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,370
? For my mind to run around With my ear up to the ground ?

19
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,790
? I'm searching to behold The stories that are told ?

20
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,000
? When my back is to the world That was smiling when I turned ?

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,790
? Tell you you're the greatest ?

22
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,660
? But once you turn, they hate us ?

23
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,410
? Oh, the misery ?

24
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:48,580
? Everybody wants to be my enemy ?

25
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:51,830
? Oh, spare the sympathy ?

26
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,790
? Everybody wants to be my enemy ?

27
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,540
? Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way ?

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,080
? My enemy ?

29
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,660
? Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint ?

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,250
? Look out for yourself ?

31
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,250
《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第六集

32
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,250
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

33
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,040
诺克萨斯向来奉行实力至上
Noxus prizes strength above all else,

34
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,080
并附有三项核心原则予以诠释
defining it by three core principles.

35
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,120
眼界 这是重中之重
Vision. The top of the triangle.

36
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,580
善于运筹帷幄 拥有能够掌控全局的智慧
Charting a course, and having the wisdom to navigate it.

37
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,250
这是你前行的基石 孩子
This form is your base, child.

38
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,080
要能看到别人所看不到的
Your eyes see what others don't.

39
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:46,580
魄力 让周围的环境为你掌控
Might. Bending your environment to your will.

40
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,290
虽然你的速度在提升 但最终你需要回归力量
Your speed is improving. But eventually you need force.

41
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,870
但用力过猛会暴露弱点
Too much force exposes you to risk.

42
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,080
确实
Indeed.

43
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,120
最后一项 是计谋
The last is guile.

44
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,950
如魅影般无踪 变戏法般灵巧 像幻术般莫测
Phantoms. Tricksters. Mages.

45
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:18,830
收起体面 卸下担当
Absent honor. Absent accountability.

46
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,750
记住 凯特琳
Remember this, Caitlyn.

47
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,750
眼里有通路 体内有热血 心中无禁忌
Tunnels in your eyes. Lava in your veins. Shadows in your heart.

48
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,410
这个就是战斗的真谛
This is the truth of combat.

49
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:44,250
而我发现了第四项原则
I've discovered a fourth principle.

50
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,950
其他所有原则都因它而升华
One that heightens all others.

51
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,040
那就是牺牲 从痛苦中孕育出来的
Sacrifice. The temper born of suffering.

52
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,370
你我感同身受 他人却难以体会
We understand it as others cannot.

53
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,910
我们一脉相承
We are kin.

54
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,040
抱歉打断一下
Pardon the interruption.

55
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,500
我追踪到他去了底城
I've tracked him to Zaun.

56
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,580
我们该去捕兽了
Let's hunt a beast.

57
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,500
蔚
Vi.

58
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,580
我一直盼着你能回来
I hoped you might return.

59
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,000
你个卑鄙无耻的叛徒
You filthy traitor.

60
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:47,000
是啊 那是我最糟的时候 糟糕透顶
Yes. That was me at my worst. Simply awful.

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,500
但曾经那个不堪的我 得到了先驱的救赎
But the Herald has freed me of my past self.

62
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,000
他给了我改过自新的机会
He's given me a chance to make amends.

63
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,160
欢迎你们的到来
All are welcome.

64
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:01,200
但烦请各位先把你们的武器交出来
But I must ask you to surrender your weapons.

65
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,120
这里是和平之地
This is a place of peace.

66
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,790
这就是先驱的愿景
The Herald's vision.

67
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,120
来吧 他正在等你们
Come, he's expecting you.

68
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,000
我们听说你能治病救人
We hear you can heal people.

69
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:03,950
维克托 你曾告诉过我 一切都是有极限的
Viktor. You once told me, all systems have limits.

70
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,870
他值得我冒险一试
He is worth the risk.

71
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:22,910
范德尔和怪物的心智 已经纠缠在一起 难以分离了
Vander's psyche is deeply entangled with that of the beast.

72
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,290
你怎么知道他的名字
How did you know his name?

73
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,660
他告诉我的
He told me.

74
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,580
以为你真能创造奇迹呢 也是全凭撞大运啊
Ask for a miracle healer, get a metal fortune cookie.

75
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
我看到了你们的父亲
I saw your father.

76
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:40,160
也看到了他心目中 你们这个小家和底城该有的模样
His dream of your family and vision of Zaun as it could have been, it was...

77
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,410
真是很美好
beautiful.

78
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,330
真能编
Cookie.

79
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,660
那你能救他吗
Can you help him?

80
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,040
我会尽我的全力试一试
I will do all in my power.

81
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,200
不过呢 我要提一个条件
However, I have one condition.

82
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,790
感觉不止一个吧
Looks like you got a couple.

83
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,580
你能为公社出不少力 爆爆
You have much to offer this commune, Powder.

84
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:09,080
你的才能应该用来建设 而不是用来破坏
Your talents can be used to build, instead of destroy.

85
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,790
我还是干我熟悉的事儿吧 谢了
I'll stick with what I know, thanks.

86
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,910
我的条件是入夜之后 必须将他关押起来
My condition is that he must be restrained at night.

87
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,500
我知道他的破坏力
I've seen the harm of which he is capable.

88
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,540
你怎么想呢
What do you think?

89
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,790
你真的在乎我怎么想
You actually want my opinion?

90
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,910
我向来最讨厌凭运气的事儿了
I hate fortune cookies.

91
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,620
一定会把你救回来的
We're gonna get you out of there, Vander.

92
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,580
? Can you find me? ?

93
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,000
? I'm not hiding ?

94
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,620
? All my memories ?

95
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:19,790
? Aren't mine now ?

96
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,040
? Not me ?

97
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,660
? Show yourself ?

98
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,700
? Not me ?

99
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,330
? Show yourself ?

100
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:43,410
? We're all creatures ?

101
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:46,910
? Who am I to you? ?

102
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,200
? Find the mirror ?

103
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,950
? See what I see ?

104
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,000
? Remember me ?

105
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,540
? Remember me I'm on my own ?

106
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,410
? Remember me I'm too far gone ?

107
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:39,000
? I couldn't see ?

108
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,700
? Remember me ?

109
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,160
? Remember me... ?

110
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,200
我的宝贝们
My girls.

111
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,620
? All my life, I couldn't breathe ?

112
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:56,910
? Remember me ?

113
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,410
? Ooh ?

114
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,790
? Ooh, ooh ?

115
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,250
? Ooh ?

116
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,830
来啊 抓不到我

117
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:22,910
(蔚奥莱 爆爆)

118
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,040
你还记得他们吗
Do you remember them?

119
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,830
我就记得妈妈身上总有一股味儿
I remember Mom's smell the most.

120
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,450
- 机油... - 机油味
- Axle grease. - Axle grease.

121
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,250
这个地方...
This place.

122
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,750
你觉得真的可以吗
Do you think it could actually work?

123
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,750
一个弱不禁风的铁皮机械先驱 打造的地下乌托邦
Underground utopia, run by a skinny tin Machine Herald.

124
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,330
那我不如坐等皮城 沦落成底城的样子得了
Maybe when Piltover slides into the sump.

125
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,330
如果我们留下呢 帮他们一把
What if we stayed? Helped them out?

126
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,540
我们
"We"?

127
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,790
前进
Forward!

128
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,120
停
Halt.

129
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,540
不能带武器
No weapons.

130
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,200
必须遵守先驱定下的规矩
I'm afraid the Herald insists.

131
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,290
容我试一试
If I may.

132
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:03,620
我想这位先驱应该是 我从前的一位学生
I believe this Herald may be a former pupil of mine.

133
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,870
一位科学家
A man of science.

134
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,790
让我先跟他谈谈
Let me speak with him.

135
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,620
今天晚上全体待命
Ready our forces for tonight.

136
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,950
我倒要去会会这位先驱
I should like to meet this Herald.

137
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,250
你也感觉到了 没错吧 能量在慢慢消减
You've felt it, haven't you? Your decline?

138
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:03,160
你的力量不是无穷的 它只会越用越少
Your power is finite, diminished by every use.

139
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,950
我一直在恭候您 博士
I've been expecting you, doctor.

140
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,620
维克托
Viktor.

141
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,580
难以置信
Incredible.

142
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,450
我是多么想透过你的双眼
What I wouldn't give to glimpse the world through your eyes.

143
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,950
去领略你所感知的一切
To know what you know.

144
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:20,660
他的追求使他误入歧途
His quest led him astray of any trodden path.

145
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,290
他的身影迷失在黑暗之中
His own shadow dissolved to darkness.

146
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,500
如今继续前行是唯一出路
Now the only course was forward.

147
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,830
而他唯一的温暖 是在梦中看她翩翩起舞
The only warmth, a dream of her waltz.

148
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,500
知识是一种悖论
Knowledge is a paradox.

149
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,410
你了解得越多
The more one understands,

150
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:42,290
越会意识到自身是多么的无知
the more one realizes the vastness of his ignorance.

151
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,290
他是绝佳的试验对象 不是吗
Marvelous specimen, isn't he?

152
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,830
他血液具有的再生功能 会让你的能力更稳定
The regenerative qualities of his blood will stabilize you.

153
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:59,040
极致的微光 能让海克斯科技发挥到极致
Apex Shimmer combined with you, the apex form of Hextech.

154
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,870
你这个想法会要了他的命
What you are suggesting would destroy him.

155
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,830
为了什么呢
And for what?

156
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:09,200
征服世界 还是为了满足好战者的贪婪
Conquest? The greed of warmongers?

157
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,910
为了成就你的大业
To complete your work.

158
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,450
为了完成我们的自我救赎
To save us from ourselves.

159
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,500
你必须活着 维克托
You must survive, Viktor.

160
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,250
你相信命运的说法吗 博士
Do you believe in fate, doctor?

161
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,370
冥冥之中一切自有安排
Our paths carved before us.

162
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,790
指引我们的是一只无形的手
Guided by an invisible hand?

163
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,160
那不是命运 是进化
Not fate, evolution.

164
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,370
大自然最伟大的力量 永远变幻莫测
Nature's greatest force, forever in flux.

165
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:43,500
不 进化是会有终点的
No. Evolution has a destination.

166
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,000
它不是为了对抗自然 而是为了超越自然
Not to combat nature, but to supersede it.

167
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,330
为了迎来最终的光荣进化
The final, glorious evolution.

168
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,290
而他也不是什么试验对象
But he isn't a specimen.

169
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,620
他是人 他需要我的帮助
He's a man. And he needs my help.

170
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,700
所以我不能为了达成你的目的 而牺牲他的人性
I will not sacrifice his humanity for your cause.

171
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,040
你可以走了
You may leave.

172
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,750
也罢 但你心里也应该很清楚
Very well. But I assume you understand already,

173
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,910
一旦你不在了 这里也将不复存在
if you perish, this community is soon to follow.

174
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,750
执行公务呢 是吧
On the job, I see.

175
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,370
你不该来这儿
You can't be here.

176
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,160
不知道哪儿冒出来个到处乱跑的
Oh. Here, like where I landed

177
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,370
富家小猫鼬把我生扑在这儿的
when this rich, unhinged mongoose just tackled me?

178
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,200
小猫鼬
Mongoose?

179
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,040
你的头发
Your hair.

180
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:39,540
看起来还挺油光锃亮的啊
You look like an angry oil slick.

181
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:43,080
少跟我卖乖 小蛋糕
Don't sugarcoat it, cupcake.

182
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:56,870
要抓谁啊
Who's out there?

183
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:04,250
我们在这儿追踪到了 某种新型的炼金武器
We tracked some sort of new chemweapon down here.

184
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,370
是一头凶残嗜血的怪物
A bloodthirsty murderous beast.

185
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,790
你来这里干什么
What are you doing here?

186
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,750
我是来这儿救我爸爸的
Trying to save... my dad.

187
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:23,080
维克托认为能把那个人 从怪物体内解救出来
Viktor believes he can save the man inside the beast.

188
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:27,540
要是成了 那头怪物对我们恐怕就失去价值了
If he succeeds, I'm afraid the creature's usefulness will be lost to us.

189
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,870
那我们就得跟他来硬的了
Then we'll have to force his hand.

190
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:35,830
我可以提取一种血清 这样就能让维克托无法得手
I believe I can craft a serum that will prohibit Viktor's success.

191
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,830
什么事
Yes?

192
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,410
是蔚
It's Vi.

193
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,660
小别重逢真是难得啊
So much for happy reunions.

194
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,290
干得好 凯特琳
Well done, Caitlyn.

195
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:47,790
是时候了
It's time.

196
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,500
真跟个泥鳅似的
Slippery as an eel.

197
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,870
就知道你能搞定的
I knew you could get it.

198
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,910
最近我也想了挺多的
Had some time to think lately.

199
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,910
自从你闯进我的生活里
Ever since you dropped into my life,

200
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,370
我就像是突然戴上了一副眼镜
it's like I put on glasses.

201
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:58,160
说不清是看得更清楚了还是更模糊了
Except I can't tell whether everything's blurry or clear.

202
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,200
你想不想听个笑话
Wanna hear a dumb joke?

203
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,450
一个多愁善感的前科犯 一个大块头的毛球怪
A sentimental ex-con, a giant furball,

204
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,080
和两个皮尔特沃夫的头号通缉犯
and two of Piltover's most wanted walk

205
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,250
走进了一个奇怪的地方
into a weird cult.

206
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,410
注意 笑点来了
And here comes the punch line.

207
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,950
蔚
Vi.

208
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:26,000
我对你可是充满了好奇啊
You've been quite a curiosity.

209
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,950
你俘获了凯特琳的芳心 算是助我一臂之力了
One who captured Caitlyn's heart. I owe you thanks.

210
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,910
没有你的一走了之 哪有我的可乘之机啊
Your absence provided a vacuum I was able to fill.

211
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,700
若不是今天这种局面
In other circumstances,

212
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,660
我很可能会将你收入麾下
I might have offered you a position in my organization.

213
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,950
坚韧如你 难能可贵
Your resilience is undeniable.

214
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,080
当然 这也很难成真
Of course, that won't be possible.

215
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,330
因为你肯定不会安分守己的
You cause too many complications.

216
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,120
你不能再让凯特琳分心了
Caitlyn must not be distracted.

217
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,790
你多虑了 她的心我分不了
Don't worry, she's not distracted.

218
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,660
我父亲让我明白了什么是信任
You know, my father taught me about trust.

219
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:06,750
他曾告诉我 想要获取信任 只要做三件事
He told me if I wanted it, there were three things I needed to do:

220
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,160
讲实话
Be honest,

221
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,290
对一个自以为是 满嘴跑火车的人
even if it means telling a self-righteous windbag

222
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:13,040
要让她知道她嘴有多臭
that her breath smells like a cesspool.

223
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,330
有耐心
Be patient.

224
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,540
这一点我总是做不好 现在被你绑着也算是帮我了
Mm, still haven't cracked that one, but being tied up sure helps.

225
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,410
那第三呢
And the third?

226
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,540
少说一点没用的废话
Just shut the fuck up.

227
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,540
整个裂沟到处都设有哨塔
The fissures are blocked by guard towers.

228
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,410
巡逻队会定时定点绕着公社巡视
Patrols circle the commune at even intervals.

229
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:49,700
她的侍卫布防在这里 这里 还有这里
Her personal guard are posted here, here and here.

230
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,790
他们想不到会后院起火
They aren't expecting trouble at home.

231
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,000
只需一个得当的时机 一点运气 外加...
With flawless timing and luck and...

232
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,040
一个吸引注意力的大动静
A big distraction.

233
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:10,040
不管你做什么 不要低估了安蓓萨
Whatever you do, don't underestimate Ambessa.

234
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,000
范德尔有麻烦了
Vander's in trouble.

235
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,250
我有个计划 但你肯定不会喜欢
I have a plan. You're not gonna like it.

236
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,370
没耽搁你太久吧
Hope I was worth your time.

237
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,500
我不会失败的
I won't... I won't fail.

238
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,870
是蔚让我来的
Vi sent me.

239
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,950
放心 我会救你出去的
I'm going to get you out of here.

240
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,540
安蓓萨那么信任你
Ambessa believed in you.

241
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,330
你死了 估计她会很难过的
Your death will be a deep cut.

242
00:28:56,410 --> 00:29:00,410
休想伤害我女儿
Don't touch my daughter.

243
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,250
你
You.

244
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,500
我不会失败的
I won't fail.

245
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,540
我绝对不会
I swear it.

246
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,370
范德尔
Vander.

247
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,700
现在我终于明白了
I understand now.

248
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,830
那种符文样式背后的信息
The message hidden within the pattern.

249
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,700
以及我们公社失败的原因
The reason for our failures in the commune.

250
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,200
博士是对的
The doctor was right.

251
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,160
这一切在所难免
It's inescapable.

252
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,000
因为人性
Humanity.

253
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,200
这是我们的本质
Our very essence.

254
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,160
我们种种的情感
Our emotions...

255
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,580
愤怒
Rage.

256
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,160
恻隐
Compassion.

257
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,200
仇恨
Hate.

258
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:37,450
如同一枚硬币 一体两面
Two sides of the same coin.

259
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,910
不可分割又相互作用
Inextricably bound.

260
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,790
范德尔 不要
Vander, wait.

261
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,080
不
No!

262
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,080
伊莎
Isha!

263
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:08,040
那些指引我们通向至善的因
That which inspires us to our greatest good...

264
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,120
同时也造就了我们最大的恶
is also the cause of our greatest evil.

265
