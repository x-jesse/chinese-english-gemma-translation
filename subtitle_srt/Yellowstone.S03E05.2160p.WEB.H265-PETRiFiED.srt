我只在没有信号的地方带手机

135

问题似乎不会自行消失  对吧
Doesn't seem to be going away on its own, does it?

140
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,140
这个不会
Not this one.

141
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,280
联邦航空局已经批准了你的一部分土地

142
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,540
作为机场的位置  我相信你已经知道了
as the airport location, as I'm sure you're aware.

143
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,110
州政府会提出条件  你拒绝后

145
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,830

146
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,660
这是州长的决定
It's the Governor's decision.

147

影响可不小
In a state where that makes a difference.

150
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,350
不支持的话  她这州长就干不下去了
Not supporting this will cost her the office.

151
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,670
你居然会反对  汤姆

机场就在你的赌场旁边

154
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,580

I have some ownership issues with the casino property.

156
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,490
我可不会帮你摆平
Well, I'm not going to help you with the problem

157
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,630
妨碍你建赌场的问题
that prevents you from building a casino.

158
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,700
赌场和机场最好一个都别建
I don't want a casino any more than I want an airport.

159
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,800
我也不希望看到别人建赌场
I don't really want another casino either.

160
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,490
这是对于印第安人收入来源的
It's an insulting-- and wickedly ironic--

161
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,260
一种侮辱  极其的讽刺
revenue stream for an Indian Nation.

162
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,190
这是为了达到目标的手段
It is a means to an end

163
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,480
最后的目标就是这个山谷
and that end is this valley looking like it did

164
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,520
完全没有白人留下的痕迹
before a white man stepped foot on it.

165
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:32,670
我们的目标一致  但原因截然不同
We want the same thing for very different reasons.

166
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:36,620
我们可以回头再战
And we can have our fight later,

167
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,220
但如果他们在这里建一座城市
but we'll have nothing to fight over

168
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,640
我们就没有什么可争的了
if they build a city here.

169
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,410
我同意
Well, I agree with you on that.

170
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,580
你知道我的商业背景
You know my business background.

171
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,900
一个项目绝不是靠一场战争就能决定是否推进的
It's never one fight that determines if a project moves forward.

172
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,610
这是战斗的积累
It's an accumulation of fights.

173
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,440
公司讨厌"复杂"
Corporations hate "Complicated".

174
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,350
他们要看到回报
And they need to see a return.

175
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,840
他们钱和人都不缺
They have the money. They have the manpower.

176
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,410
他们有权有势
They have the influence and the reach,

177
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,670
但公司缺的是时间
but the one thing corporations never have is time.

178
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,990
这是他们唯一的敌人
It's their only enemy.

179
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,330
我们要利用时间打败他们
And that's how we beat them.

180
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,250
我们给他们提供一些耗费时间的东西
We give them a dozen things that take time.

181
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,570
我这里有一个善于寻找这些东西的人
Now, I have someone with a reputation of finding those things.

182
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,550
她找到以后  可以无情地交给公司
And she is merciless when she's found them.

183
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:29,230
我正好也有一个人选
Well... I have one of those, too.

184
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,600
我知道
I'm aware.

185
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,080
这就是我来这里的原因  她们应该见个面
That's why I'm here. I think they should meet.

186
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,620
两个人商量一下
Put their heads together.

187
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,370
谁知道她们能搞出什么花样呢
Then who knows what mischief they'll come up with together.

188
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,070
我得提醒一下你
I'm just warning you:

189
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,720
我的人可不留后路的
this genie does not go back in the bottle.

190
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,040
我的人也一样
Neither does mine.

191
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,850
先交易员一步
Get in front of the trader.

192
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,920
嗯  等等
Right. Wait.

193
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,730
我在看
I'm watching.

194
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,680
就现在  135点卖30万
Now. Three hundred-thousand at one thirty-five.

195
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,900
他买了就告诉我
Tell me when he takes.

196
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:28,190
卖空我的股票
Short my fucking stock...

197
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,410
买了吗  太好了
Bought? Yes!

198
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:34,410
舒服了吧  红发小贱人
Take that you little red-headed shit.

199
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,740
喂
Yeah.

200
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,520
什么
What?

201
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,510
又跌了一点
Another point?

202
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,890
我要去钓鱼啊
I'm trying to go fucking fishing!

203
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,320
操了
God!

204
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,750
操
God!

205
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,510
为什么我们不和他们一起走
Why can't we ride with them?

206
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,080
因为那条路太难走了
'Cause that's a pretty rough haul.

207
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,920
老蓝色牛仔裤心中装不下大山了
Old Blue Jeans, he ain't got any more mountains in him.

208
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,590
蓝色牛仔裤是谁
Who's Blue Jeans?

209
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,540
蓝色牛仔裤是你要骑的马
Blue Jeans is the horse you're gonna be ridin'.

210
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,160
它和你爸爸的岁数差不多大
He's almost as old as your daddy.

211
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,260
我还记得你爸爸以前到处乱跑
In fact, I can remember when your daddy used to run

212
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,850
还要骑那匹傻...
all over hell and gone on that son of a...

213
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:40,930
好马
Son of a gun.

214
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,350
你们这些牧民别在他面前说脏话了
The pirate mouth on that kid needs no help from you wranglers.

215
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,310
-你们能  -对不起
- If y'all could just... - Sorry.

216
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,930
抱歉
I'm sorry.

217
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,910
我孩子说脏话其实也不怪你
It's not your responsibility what my kid says.

218
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:57,610
我们在他面前会注意言辞的
We'll try and really watch what we say around him.

219
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,110
谢谢
I'd appreciate it.

220
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,080
咚咚
Knock knock.

221
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,730
谁啊
Who's there?

222
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,630
欧洲
Europe.

223
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,500
哪个欧洲
Europe, who?

224
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,290
是你这个混蛋
No, you're a poo!

225
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,550
算了  他这是天生的
Nope. It's just in him.

226
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,150
但他笑得很开心啊  不是吗
He's laughing, though, ain't he?

227
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,590
是的
Yeah, he is.

228
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:21,640
这个可教不来
You can't teach that.

229
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,780
什么教不来
Teach what?

230
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,180
韧性
Toughness.

231
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,230
人一生下来  不是柳树就是橡树
You're either born a willow or you're born an oak.

232
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,000
就这么简单
That's all there is to it.

233
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,730
你们俩准备好了吗
You two ready?

234
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:39,980
好了
Ready ready.

235
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,460
什么鬼
What in the...

236
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,200
它们是从公园溜进来的吗
You think they wandered in from the park?

237
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,060
不是  那边围栏很多的
Nah, there's too many fences.

238
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,790
这群狗娘养的是谁
Who are these son of a bitches here?

239
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,270
去看看
Come on. Let's go.

240
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,770
运动俱乐部还养上野牛了
Sporting Club running buffalo now?

241
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,090
运动俱乐部啥也不弄了
Sporting Club ain't running shit no more.

242
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:30,670
好吧  那些是谁的牛
Yell, well, whose are those, then?

243
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,050
这不重要  反正不是你们的
Don't matter, as long as they're not yours.

244
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,530
你们有许可证吗
You got permission to run them things here?

245
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,200
没有  我今天刚决定在农场养点野牛
No, I just decided today I'd run some buffalo

246
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,140
也没什么特殊的原因
across a field for no reason.

247
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,780
我的牛要是因为那些破玩意
Yeah, well, I don't want my cattle getting brucellosis

248
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,990
染上布鲁氏菌病就不好了
from them fucking things.

249
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,900
别让你的牛穿过围栏就行了
Keep your cattle on your side of the fence.

250
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,900
告诉你的马仔
You oughta tell your boy

251
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,320
和我说话的时候注意点
to watch the bass in his voice when he speaks to me.

252
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,200
马仔
Boy?

253
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:05,870
信不信我爆了你的头
I'll blow your shit-for-brains all over this field.

254
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,210
有本事就试试
Then fucking do it.

255
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,340
保护区探员  牲畜委员会
Reserve agent, Livestock Association.

256
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,800
不许动  不然我就开枪了
I will shoot you where you stand.

257
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,510
把手枪放下
Put that fucking pistol down.

258
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,140
保护区探员
Reserve agent?

259
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,270
达顿还在那骗人呢
Duttons are still running that scam?

260
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,530
我们不认识你
We don't know you.

261
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,250
的确  但你们老板认识
You wouldn't. But your boss does.

262
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,480
告诉他韦德·莫罗向他问好
Tell him Wade Morrow said hello.

263
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,040
我相信我们还会见面的
We'll see each other again, I'm sure.

264
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,030
你还是祈祷咱俩再也不见吧
You better hope I never see you again.

265
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,800
下次和我来个公平的对决
Next time, fight me fair.

266
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,300
操  现在就来啊
Shit, I'll fight you fair.

267
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,450
下马
Get off your horse.

268
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,620
下次再说吧
We'll save that for a rainy day.

269
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,000
我需要它们没有感染布鲁氏菌病的证据
I need proof those are brucellosis free.

270
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,670
如果你够爷们的话  就来拿吧
If you're man enough, come and get it.

271
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:49,790
走吧
Come on.

272
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,800
他们为什么要把野牛留在这里
Why would they leave buffalo out here?

273
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,880
它们会把围栏毁掉的
They're gonna tear this fence to pieces.

274
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:58,390
这就是为什么
That's why.

275
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,380
现在5点了
You know, it's 5 o'clock.

276
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,010
你不应该在河里吗
Shouldn't you be in a river somewhere?

277
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,680
威士忌  加冰
Bulleit. Rocks.

278
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,660
我最喜欢的就是在河里钓鱼
There's nothing I love more than to be on the river,

279
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,910
但我来这里是想弄清楚
but instead, I'm here trying to figure out

280
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,150
你为什么要摸老虎屁股
why you are poking a grizzly.

281
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,320
你钓到鱼以后  并不会留着
You don't keep them when you catch them.

282
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,910
没错
No.

283
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,950
你会把鱼扔回河里
You throw them back.

284
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,000
是的
Yes.

285
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,790
你要是吃了  还可以得到我的尊重
I could respect you if you ate them.

286
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,020
这样我比较能理解一点
That makes sense to me.

287
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,380
但是鳟鱼一整天要经历的破事
But of all the shit a trout has to go through in a day...

288
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,760
老鹰想吃掉它
eagles trying to eat them,

289
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,840
浣熊想吃掉它
raccoons trying to eat them,

290
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,510
水獭  鱼鹰  大鱼  鹰
otters, ospreys, bigger fish, hawks.

291
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:31,120
它还要思考漂浮的死昆虫身上
It also has to wonder if every floating dead insect

292
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,410
有没有钩子  因为你觉得它
has a fucking hook in it because you think it

293
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,610
为了生命和你斗智斗勇
fighting you for its life...

294
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,570
很有趣
Is fun.

295
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,500
钩子不会弄疼鱼
It doesn't hurt the fish.

296
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:44,570
鱼不像其他动物那样处理疼痛
They don't process pain the way other animals do--

297
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,540
鱼素者是这么跟你说的吗
What fucking pescatarian told you that, huh?

298
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,680
这个星球上有一种脊椎动物
It is fascinating that the one vertebrate

299
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:59,510
不依赖疼痛作为生存手段
on this planet that doesn't rely on pain as a survival device

300
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:03,690
你就喜欢钩住它们的嘴  好棒棒哦
is the one that you like to hook in the fucking mouth.

301
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,530
说实话  鱼疼不疼关我屁事
To be honest, I could give a shit if it hurts the fish.

302
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,910
我不喜欢鱼的味道  所以我把它们扔回去了
I don't like the way it tastes. That's why I throw them back.

303
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,140
你为什么一开始不说呢
Well, why didn't you say that in the first place, huh?

304
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,770
那我就懂了呀
That I understand.

305
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,650
舒瓦茨和梅耶公司正在卖空我们的股票
Schwartz and Meyer shorting our stock

306
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,490
就像恐怖分子炸地铁一样
is like a terrorist bombing a subway.

307
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,000
这样无法阻止地铁
It doesn't stop the subways

308
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,720
也不会破坏地铁服务的城市
and it doesn't destroy the city the subway serves.

309
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,550
只是伤害了一些人
It just hurts some people,

310
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,340
而且并非是你想伤害的人
and not the people you want to hurt.

311
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,410
但这样会让你想伤害的人
But it does make the people you want to hurt

312
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,210
以牙还牙
want to hurt you back.

313
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,750
你想以牙还牙
You going to try and hurt me back,

314
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,090
这就是你想说的吗
is that what you're trying to say?

315
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:45,090
这种事我经历过很多次了  伙计
Because I have been down this road many, many times before, buddy.

316
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,200
很可惜  尝试过的人都死了
And no one who tried it is alive to tell you

317
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,610
他们没办法告诉你效果有多差了
how poorly that worked out for them.

318
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,240
什么意思  你是说如果我找你算账
What, are you saying you're going to hire a fucking hitman

319
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,980
你就要雇杀手干掉我吗
to come after me if I come after you?

320
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,280
我们可以买下十五个舒瓦茨和梅耶公司
We could buy Schwartz and Meyer fifteen times over.

321
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,800
那片土地不是你家族的遗产
That land is not your family's legacy.

322
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,010
这是一个可以继续增值的遗迹
It is a relic that will continue to appreciate

323
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,890
直到你的家人负担不起
until your family can no longer afford it

324
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,500
然后你们就会失去它
and then you will lose it.

325
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,920
财富是唯一的遗产  你知道的
Wealth is the only legacy left, and you know it.

326
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,270
和我们作对  你就会输掉所有的钱
Fight us and you'll lose all your money

327
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,520
还有土地
and you lose the land.

328
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,170
你也可以做个聪明的女商人
Or be the smart business woman you are

329
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:29,030
与我们达成协议  为你的家庭创造真正的遗产
and make us a deal that creates a real legacy for your family.

330
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,970
五六亿的遗产
Five, six hundred-million dollars.

331
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,220
世代的财富
Generational wealth.

332
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,940
你说的我都同意  罗尔克
I agree on all fronts, Roarke.

333
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,230
真的
I do.

334
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,000
我向上帝祈祷他愿意这么做
And I wish to God that he would do that,

335
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,110
但他不会的
but he won't.

336
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,530
所以我们战斗吧
So, we fight.

337
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,180
你把自己封在了阿拉莫  贝丝
You're sealing yourself into the Alamo, Beth.

338
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:56,120
这些人也是只杀不俘的
And these guys won't take prisoners either.

339
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,880
我很期待
I look forward to it.

340
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:10,220
别卖空我的股票  求你了
Stop shorting my fucking stock, please.

341
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,640
那你别让我轻易得逞啊
Well, stop making it so fucking easy.

342
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,910
你能在盘后交易吗
Could you at least do it in after hours trading

343
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,910
让我好好钓个鱼呗
so I can fucking fish?

344
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,160
这没问题
Well, that I can do.

345
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,120
我可以在盘后卖空你的股票
I will short your stock in after-hours trading

346
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,030
让你可以安心折磨鳟鱼
so you can torture trout.

347
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,570
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

348
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,830
贝丝  你自以为准备好了
You think you're up for this fight, Beth.

349
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,660
但你其实大错特错
You have no idea how wrong you are.

350
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:40,500
彼此彼此
Well, right back at you.

351
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,460
你是拖车公园
You are the trailer park.

352
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,090
我是龙卷风
I am the tornado.

353
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,880
第一天上任感觉如何
How was your first day?

354
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,380

Boyd Nelson died.

355
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,130
饲马人
The horse breeder?

356
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,430
其实我不认识他
I didn't really know him.

357
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,850
他是个梦想家
He was a dreamer.

358
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,770
那些梦想没有实现  他变成了
When those dreams didn't come true he became...

359
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,230
他变得很易怒
He was an angry, angry guy.

360
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,070
留置权人取消了牧场的抵押赎回权
The lien-holder's foreclosing on his ranch.

361
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,050

362
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,910
是300匹左右的母马  还有些马驹

363
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,870
我想着把它们圈起来

364
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,180
送到比林斯卖了
take them down to Billings, put them in a sale.

365
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,840
帮帮他的家人

366
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:03,010
前提是他家值得我这么做

他妻子是个好女人

368
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,810
反正博伊德配不上她
Better than Boyd deserved, that's for sure.

369
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,690
她真是可惜了
I'm sorry for her.

00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,900
如果银行发现的话  会有点风险

你的工作就是为他们着想
Do what's best for them. That's the job.

你是说我应该帮他们吗

375
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,750
我什么也没说  这不是我要做的决定

里普  你知道怎么办
Rip, have you figured out how to do this

382
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,640
才能不被马群践踏吗
without all of us getting trampled?

383
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,840
我们想到的最好的办法是"管它呢"
Best we came up with sir is like, "fuck it", you know?

384
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:24,770
我们尽快上去
Let's get up there fast as we can

385
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,050
把那些马赶下山
and just chase those sons of bitches down the mountain.

386
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,300
管它呢
Fuck it.

387
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,400
这也是你的计划吗  "管它呢"
That's your plan, too? Fuck it?

388
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,680
不管我们怎么做  场面都不会好看
It's gonna be a shit show no matter what we do.

389
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,060
还不如快一点
May as well do it fast.

390
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,940
减少出错的时间
Less time for things to go wrong.

391
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,570
你的逻辑有缺陷  儿子
Your logic is so flawed, son, it...

392
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,070
操  我还真挑不出理来
Hell, it almost makes sense.

393
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,240
真棒
Great.

394
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,160
好吧

管它呢
Fuck it.

398
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:58,080
我有点想上山再来一次
You know, I've got half a mind to run up that hill and do it again.

我觉得我应该亲口告诉你

作为该州最高执法官员

我也想问自己同样的问题

417
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,320
老实说  兰迪
To be honest with you, Randy,

418
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,700

我也想多卖点  但是
Was hoping to get more, but...

446
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:31,080
这钱可以用来办葬礼
Should help with the funeral.

478
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,590
这不关我的事

她是舞蹈演员  她学过

你现在明白那个笑话了吗  吉米
You're getting the joke now, aren't you, Jimmy?

这么美的日落  那群蠢货真能煞风景
Only those dipshits could ruin a sunset.

495

That is shocking to me.

500
00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:30,700
你们这群蠢货在干什么
What the fuck are you dipshits doing?

501
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,720
我早该猜到是你的
I should've known it was you.

502
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,470
你还不了解我嘛
By now, you sure should have.

503
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,370
你们在举办工棚舞会吗
You're having a barn dance or something?

504
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,000
嗯

趁着晚上好好放松一下吧
Now it sounds like they're gonna have one hell of a night.

508
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,310
你今天做了件好事
It's a good thing you did today.

509
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:40,110
你违反了一条原本就不应该立法的法律
You broke a rule that shouldn't be a rule in the first place.

510
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:42,830
你这么做的理由很充分
And you did it for the right reasons.

511
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,650
谢谢
Thanks.

512
00:41:51,590 --> 00:41:53,040
我们去凑个热闹吧
Hell, should we join 'em?

513
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,330
我不能去
I can't.

514
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,170
我无法同时成为他们的老板和朋友
I never had much luck leading men and being their friend.

515
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,960
说不定你可以呢
Maybe it can be different for you.

516
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,340
晚安  儿子
Goodnight, son.
