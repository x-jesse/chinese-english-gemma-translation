00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,160
嗯
Mm-hmm.

159
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,080
他是威兰合成人 能跟母亲沟通
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic. He speaks Mother.

160
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,620
他能进入船上的终端机
He can access a terminal on the ship to get us in 

161
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,200
让我们轻松进出
and out without a fuss.

162
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,620
只有那样才能进去
It's the only way to get in.

163
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,870
要是我们被逮到呢
Okay, but what if we get caught?

164
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,500
获得旅行许可的机会就没了
It'll ruin our chances of ever getting a travel permit.

165
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,200
好 小雨不去
Right, Rain's not comin'.

166
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,620
不然你让我们带安迪去
How about you let us take Andy then?

167
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:55,790
我才不让我弟自己上去
I'm not sending my brother up there alone.

168
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,660
他不是你弟吧
He's not your brother though, is he?

169
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,870
比约恩 给我闭嘴 -没错啊
- Bjorn, shut the fuck up. - It's true, though, isn't it?

170
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,290
他不是你弟 只是威兰的瑕疵品
He's not your brother. It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods…

171
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,910
你爸在垃圾里找到的
that your dad found in the trash.

172
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,000
如此而已 认清现实吧
And that's all he is, Rain. So just wake up.

173
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,830
我们走
Let's go.

174
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,580
小雨 -怎样 我又没说什么
- Rain? - What? I didn't say anything.

175
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,080
小雨 等等
Rain, wait.

176
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,000
抱歉 我表弟有时很机车
I'm sorry. Listen, I know my cousin can be a dick sometimes, all right?

177
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,830
可是他说对了一件事
But he is right about something.

178
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
你得认清现实
You need to wake up.

179
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,040
这家公司什么都不会给我们
Because this company, they're not gonna give us anything.

180
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
你也明白我们只能放手一搏
You know that as well as I do. We have to take it.

181
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,450
小雨 我…
Rain, I just…

182
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,000
我不想落得跟我们爸妈一样
I don't want to end up like our parents.

183
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,950
你想吗
Do you?

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,500
你们的计划有听起来那么容易吗
Is it as easy as you're making it sound, this plan of yours?

185
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,410
你根本不必离开科布伦号
You won't even have to get out of the Corbelan.

186
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,540
这点我能保证
That much I can promise you, okay?

187
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,120
好啦 你愿意吗
Come on. What do you say?

188
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,000
比约恩 快 走了
Bjorn, hurry up, let's go.

189
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,040
好 我要发动了 启动电池
All right, I'm starting her up. Batteries on.

190
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
很好
Lovely.

191
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,620
给我看氢气引擎
Could I get hydro, please?

通讯控制台
Comm panel.

193
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,830
地面扰流板
Ground spoilers.

194
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,080
准备就绪
They are armed.

195
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,160
第一次上太空吗
First time in space, huh?

196
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,330
对
Yeah.

197
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,620

燃油汞
Fuel pump.

199
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,120
开启 -两个太空菜鸟来了
- On. - Two space virgins coming through.

200
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,620
好好看看窗外
Right, take a good look outside the window…

201
00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:50,870
我觉得我们不会回来了
'cause the way I see it, we're never coming back.

202
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,290
还好吗
You good?

203
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:06,450
我很好
I'm good.

204
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,450
会很顺利啦
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

205
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,250
现在还觉得这是好主意吗
Are you sure this is a good idea now?

206
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,500
当然 老爸
Sure, Dad.

207
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,200
强重力来了
Here comes the crush.

208
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:57,750
就是这样
That's how it's done, bitch.

209

我看过

00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,290
在梦里
In my dreams.

215
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,250
我等不及陪你一起看
I can't wait to see them with you.

216
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
嗯
Yeah.

217
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,620
听说冻眠会让好多年…
You know, I heard that cryo-sleep just makes years…

218
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,330
感觉像狂饮一夜
feel like one night of heavy drinkin' apparently.

219
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,540
等明天在伊瓦加星醒来
So when we wake up in Yvaga tomorrow…

220

我们就会宿醉

退役的前哨站 不知道
Decommissioned outpost? I don't know.

226
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:01,330
应该是被拖进我们的轨道
Probably got dragged into our orbit.

227
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,410
纳瓦洛 麻烦靠近点
Okay, Navarro, let's get closer, please.

228

小行星带比我想的近了一点

为什么要穿这个
Now, why I gotta put this on for?

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:42,160
你的蛋蛋才不会冻坏
So you don't freeze your balls off.

安迪 别理他
Andy, take no notice.

266
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,120
他弄坏东西与我无关
All right, okay, won't be my fault when he breaks somethin'.

267
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,250
前面有合成舱门 我要对接了

温度扫描仪
It's a temp-scanner.

272
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,290
能带我们去找冻眠舱
It's gonna lead us to the pods.

273
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,580
压力够
Okay, compression is good enough.

274
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,870
氧气太稀薄 无法呼吸
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.

275
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,870
安迪
Andy…

276

走吧
Okay, let's go.

284
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,410
靠
Fuck.

285
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,410
我们应该进入零重力状态了
Guys, it looks like we're in zero-g.

286
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,450
我的肚子感觉得到
Yeah, I can feel it in my stomach.

287
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:10,950
那是什么
Wait, what's that?

288
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,410
重力产生器
Gravity generators.

289
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:15,120
离线后仍定时自我清除
When offline, they still purge themselves every few minutes.

291
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:23,410

Oh, fuck me, there goes my stomach again.

292
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,700
好 正前方
Okay, straight ahead.

293
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,500
根据扫描仪 冻眠舱应该在这里
According to the scanner, the pods should be in here.

294
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
天啊
Jesus.

295
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,910
安迪 还好吗
Andy, you good?

296
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,000
还好

靠
Fuck!

301
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,540
我屁眼裂开了
I think I fractured my asshole.

302
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:08,870
重力清除不是闹着玩的
Fuckin' hell. Don't fuck with this gravity purge, man.

303
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,250
（系统启动）

304
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,000
幸好这残骸里还有电
Thank God, there's still some power left in this relic.

305
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,120
（氧气复原）

306
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,200
（重力产生器上线）

307
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,290
小心 重力回来了
Okay, watch out. Gravity's coming back.

308
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,160
他妈的
Fuckin' hell.

好
Okay.

312
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,790
（3.2年）

313
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,790
可恶
Shit.

314
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:07,080
什么问题
What's the problem?

315
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,830
冻眠舱燃料不足
Pods don't have enough fuel.

316
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,160
什么意思
What do you mean?

317
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,290
他们装了停滞三年用的燃料
They're loaded up for three years in stasis.

318
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,120
可是到伊瓦加星要九年
Yeah, but it takes nine years to get to Yvaga, mate.

319
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:16,370
我知道 我明白
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm aware of that.

320
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,870
他妈的
Fuckin' hell.

321
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,290
我知道 我就知道
I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.

322
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,450
我就知道 -别激动
- I knew it. - Just relax.

323
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,700
也许你们应该回来
Maybe you guys should just come back.

324
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:23,000
还不能放弃
No, no, we're not givin' up now.

325
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,250
伊瓦加星是最近的系统
Yvaga's the nearest system.

326
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,410
现在该怎么办
So what are we supposed to do now? Huh?

327
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,790
怎么办 -闭嘴
- What are we gonna do? - Shut up.

328
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,290
读数很强 一定是附近的冷冻仓库
Okay, strong reading. Must be a cryo depot nearby.

329
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,870
那里应该有更多燃料
We should find more fuel there.

330
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,370
纳瓦洛 我要弹射紧急逃生艇
Navarro, I'm ejecting the EEV.

331
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
过来 安迪
Come on, Andy.

332
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,620
你们接逃生艇 我们找燃料
You guys pick it up while we get the cryo-fuel.

333
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,910
等等
Hold.

334
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,000
四百码外 正前方
Yeah, 400 yards away, dead ahead.

335
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,750
干嘛用军人的口令
What's with the military shit?

336
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,910
什么 -你刚说的那些
- What? - All that military shit.

337
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,450
效率高 -是吗
- Well, it's effective. - Is it?

338
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
又很酷 -才怪
- And cool. - It's not very cool.

339
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:16,910
你看起来很蠢
You just look like a twat.

340
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:19,080
对不起 -别激动
- I'm sorry. - All right, chill.

341
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,160
继续前进
Let's keep it movin'.

342
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:21,330
再这样我扁你
If you do that again, I'll fuck you up.

343
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,120
比约恩 别闹了 -懂吗
- Bjorn, back off! - You understand?

344
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,660
只要他别来惹我
Just as long as he stays out of my way.

345
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,790
他干嘛对他这么坏
Why is he being such a dick to him?

346
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,450
因为发生在他妈身上的事
Because of what happened to his mom.

347
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,000
什么意思
What do you mean?

348
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,330
上个周期 矿区瓦斯外泄
Last cycle, there was a gas leak in the mines…

349
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,410
有个合成人决定封闭矿区
so a synthetic made the call to seal 

350
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,370
但比约恩的妈妈还困在里头
them with Bjorn's mom still trapped inside.

351

什么
What?

352
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,370
合成人不能伤害人类
Synthetics can't harm humans.

353
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,540
为了救十几个人 牺牲了三名矿工
It sacrificed three miners to save a dozen.

354
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:46,910
他们可以那么做
That, they can do.

355
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,580
太可怕了
That's terrible.

356
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,330
（紧急逃生艇弹射启动）

357
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,250

我在这里 没事
I'm right here. I'm right here. You're okay.

367
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,540
我去看看冻眠舱
I'm gonna go check on the pods.

368
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,620
不 别担心
No, no. Don't worry.

369
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,580
我没生病
I'm not sick.

370
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,250
那是怎么回事
What's wrong, then?

371
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,290
没事
Nothing is.

372
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,160
天啊
Oh, girl.

373
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:43,250
孩子的爸是谁
Who's the father?

374
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,790
一个混蛋
Some asshole.

375
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,950
别告诉我哥 好吗
Just don't tell my brother, okay?

376
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,620
他烦恼够多了
- He has enough things to worry about. - No.

377
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,200
我不会说
I won't say anything.

378
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,950
我很高兴这宝宝能见到太阳
I'm just happy this baby will get to see the sun.

（威兰企业 打造美好世界）

380

应该快到了
I think we're almost there.

381
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,040

这里害我起鸡皮疙瘩
This place gives me the creeps.

390
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:00,330
听过有矿工失去左半边吗
Did you hear about the miner who lost his left side?

391
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,950
他现在是右翼分子
He's all right now.

392
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,540
懂吗 他是右翼分子
Do you get it? He's all right.

393
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,410
你能关闭自己吗
Can you turn yourself off, please?

394
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,950
你说你很紧张
You said you were nervous…

395

我等不及要进冻眠舱
You know, I can't wait to get in them pods…

397

再也别见到你 懂吗
and never see you again, you know that?

398
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,080
你在伊瓦加星会见到我
You'll see me in Yvaga.

399

你没有要去伊瓦加星
No, you're not going to Yvaga.

401
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,540
真的吗
I'm not?

402

算你狠
Well done.

她没告诉你吗
Oh, she didn't tell you?

404

对 那是非威兰系统
Yeah, yeah, it's a non-Weyland-Yutani system…

Andy, look.

如果你们待在杰克森星
And if you guys stay in Jackson, it's just a matter of time…

410

before you get decommissioned again by the company.

411
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,660
懂吗
You understand?

412

你在船上看守冻眠舱
I need you on the ship to guard the pods.

413

等我们到那里…
But once we get there…

414

没关系
That's okay.

419
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,870
对小雨好就是对我好
If it's what's best for Rain, it's what's best for me.

You're a good guy, Andy.

421
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,080
我们会想你的
We're all gonna miss you.

422
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,160
所以他不知道
So he didn't know?

423
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,250
我就是不忍心告诉他
I just did not have the heart to tell him.

424
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,450
你不必难过
You shouldn't feel bad.

425
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
可恶
Shit.

426
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,160
别为了安迪浪费一辈子
You're not gonna throw your whole life away for Andy's sake.

427
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,950
他不在乎 那对他不重要
He doesn't care. It doesn't matter to him.

428
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,160
他不…
Okay? He's not…

429
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,950
不是真的
you know, real.

430
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,540
讯号来自这里
The signal's coming from in here.

431
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,620
你不是说这里停用了
Thought you said this place was decommissioned.

432
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:31,790
对
Yeah.

433
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:34,540
看起来不像
Doesn't look decommissioned to me.

434
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,000
没错
No, it doesn't.

435
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,160
但确实遭到弃置
But it's definitely deserted.

436
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,080
安迪 你看
Hey, Andy, look at this.

437
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:43,450
用这个应该能电死合成人
I could probably fry a synthetic with one of these…

438
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,790
只要我增强电力
if I just amp up the juices.

439
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,750
我可能带这个走
Hey, you know, I might take this with me, actually.

440
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,750
够了
All right, enough.

441
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,000
以免你有什么怪念头
Just in case you have any fucking funny ideas.

442
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,120
玩笑 我开玩笑的
It's a joke. I was joking.

443
00:32:58,290 --> 00:32:59,290
搞屁啊
What the fuck?

444
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,790
小心
Watch out.

445
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,500
靠
Shit.

446
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,580
只是个合成人
It's only a synthetic.

447
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
靠
Fuck.

448
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,540
我差点以为是真人
I thought it was a real person there for a second.

449
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,000
那里发生什么事
What happened in there?

450
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:28,080
不知道 也许是化学物质外泄
Don't know. A chemical spill, maybe.

451
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,000
燃料一定在那房间 我们拿了就走
The fuel must be in that room. Let's grab it and get the fuck out of here.

452
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,370
（冷冻室）

453
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,250
好 安迪
All right. Andy?

454
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,000
比约恩 请拿手电筒
Bjorn, take the torch please.

455
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,620
（冷冻燃料 危险）

456
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,040
我觉得这里没有冻眠舱
I don't think there's any pods in here.

457
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,330
只是冷却设备 用同样的燃料
Nah, just cooling equipment. Uses the same type of fuel, though.

458
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,660
太好了
Yes.

459
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,790
45公斤
Forty-five Ks.

460
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:18,080
到伊瓦加星绰绰有余
It's more than enough fuel to get us to Yvaga.

461
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:21,200
比约恩 麻烦帮我一下
Right. Bjorn, give me a hand with this, please.

462
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,250
比约恩 数到三往外拉
Bjorn, pull it out on three, all right?

463
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,750
准备好了吗
- Ready? - Uh-huh.

464
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,120

靠 -我的手指
- Fuck. - My fingers.

468
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,830
我手指没感觉了
I can't feel my fingers.

469
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,120
好痛 我的手冻坏了
It really hurts. Just froze my hands off.

470
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:53,950
怎么了 -靠
- What's happening? - Fuck.

471
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,540
不知道 某种紧急封锁
Don't know. It's some kind of emergency lockdown.

472
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,120
安迪 开门
Andy, the door.

473
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,750
（请联络科学官）

474
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,200
他没有权限
Shit, he doesn't have the clearance.

475
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,290
什么意思
What does that mean?

476
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,660
没有开门的权限
Doesn't have the clearance to open the door.

477
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,080
你是说他能重启整艘船
So you're trying to tell me that he can fucking reboot the entire ship…

478
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,160
却不能打开一个普通房间的门
but can't open a random fucking door to a random room?

479
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:13,540
显然那不是普通的房间
Well, obviously, that's no random room.

480
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,750
快啊
Come on!

481
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,410
快啊
Come on!

482
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,540
放心 我们会救他们出来
Hey, don't worry. We'll get 'em out of there.

483
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:46,620
如果安迪打不开 我们应该也没辙
If Andy can't open those doors, I doubt we'll have better luck.

484
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:50,000
他是威兰合成人
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic…

485
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,790
我们这是非法入侵
and we're just trespassing.

486
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,120
对 有什么想法吗
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

487
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:55,830
还没
Not yet.

488
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,910
我想在这里
I think it's in here.

489
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,620
比约恩
Bjorn!

490
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,450
泰勒
Tyler!

491
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,040
他们在里面
They're in there.

492
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,830
你在干嘛
Hey, what are you doing?

493
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,000
如果这个模组还能用
If this module is still working, 

494
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,700
我想传它的凭证给安迪
I can try to transfer its credentials to Andy.

495
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,000
更高的权限应该能开门
A higher clearance should open that door.

496
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,500
（标本完成 打印暂停）

497
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,160
可恶 卡住了
Shit. It's stuck.

498
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,660
这里面好热
It's so hot in here, man.

499
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,410
（X光灯 贴紧身体使用）

500
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,450
哇
Whoa.

501
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
超赞
Sick.

502
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,700
别乱碰这里的东西
Yeah, maybe try not to touch anything in here.

503
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:37,790
好 老妈
Yeah, okay, Mom.

504
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,620
快帮我 帮我
Help me! Help!

505
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:44,790
糟糕 该怎么做
Oh, no! What do I do?

506
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,410
模组 拿出来
The module. Take it out!

507
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,160
你还好吗
You okay?

508
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,790
太奇怪了
That was fucked up.

509
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,950
拿去
Here.

510
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,580
我看看
Let me see.

511
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,870
对 好
Yes, okay.

512
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,250
好了
All right.

513
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,250
搞定 -嘿
- Got it. - Hey.

514
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:06,410
小雨
Rain.

515
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,410
从那个合成人身上取出的
This is from that synthetic.

516
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,410
放在安迪的模组上
Try putting it on Andy's module.

517
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,700
真的很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

518
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:20,000
我们离开这里吧
Let's just get outta here.

519
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,700
安迪
Andy?

520
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:26,620
试试看
All right, let's see.

521
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:30,950
好
Okay.

522
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,950
靠
Fuck.

523
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,080
小雨 我做错了什么 他不动了
Rain, did I do something wrong? He's just frozen up.

524
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,540
他在重开机
He's just rebooting.

525
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,450
需要几分钟
It's gonna take a couple of minutes.

526
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,120
我拿东西包扎你的手指
Here, let me get you something for those fingers.

527
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,410
那是什么鬼
The fuck was that?

528
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,080
在那边待一下子
All right, stay there a second.

529
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
泰勒
Tyler?

530
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:32,290
你们在做什么
Hey, what are you guys doing?

531
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,540
比约恩
Bjorn?

532
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:44,540
别闹了 快起来
Stop playing around, man. Just get up.

533
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,000
我没有 水里有东西
I'm not playing around. There's something in the water.

534
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,500
什么东西
What do you mean? What is it?

535
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,370
不知道 水里有东西
I don't know. I don't know what it is. There's something in the fuckin' water.

536
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,120
比约恩
Bjorn!

537
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,450
靠
Fuck!

538
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,750
那是什么
What the fuck was that?

539
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,200
安迪
Andy!

540
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,580
比约恩
Bjorn!

541
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,750
比约恩 快想办法救他
Bjorn, help him! Do something!

542
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,950
比约恩
Bjorn!

543
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,120
泰勒 -对不起…
- Tyler! - I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

544
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,450
快点
Come on!

545
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,790
快来帮我 -不要…
- Come on! Help me! - No, stop. Stop. Don't…

546
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,580
不 纳瓦洛 -那些东西会出来
- No! Navarro! - Those things will get out.

547
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,540
过来…如果它们过来…
If they come in here… If they come in… If they come…

548
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:37,700
不
No!

549
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,790
靠…
Fuck. Fuck.

550
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:10,910
安迪 我们走
Andy! Let's go!

551
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,080
快 比约恩
Go! Bjorn!

552
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,250
安迪 开门
Andy, the door!

553
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,290
比约恩 -快点
- Bjorn! - Come on, come on.

554
00:41:17,450 --> 00:41:18,450
快点…
Come on, come on, come on!

555
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:19,700
（获准进入）

556
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,370
快出来 -快点…
- Get out of there! - Come on, come on, come on!

557
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:23,500
快… -快走
- Come on, come on, come on! - Go, go, go!

558
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,250
快出来…
Get out of there! Get out of there!

559
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,040
比约恩 快 -快走
- Bjorn, come on! - Go! Go!

560
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,870
安迪 关门
Andy, the door!

561
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,160
别动 -我知道
- Stay still. Stay still. - I know!

562
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,620
它掐住她了
It's choking her.

563
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:57,580
快住手
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!

564
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:58,950
它掐住她了 -可恶
- It's choking her! - Shit.

565
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,000
住手 比约恩
Stop! Bjorn!

566
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,750
比约恩 快住手
Bjorn, stop! For fuck's sake, stop!

567
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,200
住手 -它要杀死她吗
- Stop! - What's it doin'? Is it fuckin' killin' her?

568
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,620
我认为那不是它的目的
I do not believe that's what the creature is doing.

569
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,080
不是
No.

570
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,580
安迪
Andy?

571
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,950
根据那些囊的扩张节奏
Based on the rhythmic dilatation of those bladders…

572
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,410
而且与她呼吸模式同步
and its synchronization to her breathing patterns…

573
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,250
我猜它在输氧给她 让她活命
I'd surmise it's feeding her oxygen to keep her alive.

574
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,580
但我不知道用意何在
For what purpose, I do not know.

575
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:24,870
你到底是谁
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

576
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,500
我是ND255威兰合成人
I'm an ND-255 Weyland-Yutani synthetic.

577
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:32,160
为执行采矿与安全任务而建造
Originally built for mining and safety tasks.

578
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,330
你们都叫我安迪
You guys call me Andy.

579
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,750
是那个模组
It's that module.

580
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,580
对
Yes.

581
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,500
新模组不只升级我的凭证
That new module didn't just upgrade my credentials.

582
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,290
还大幅升级我的人工智能
It substantially updated my AI…

583
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,160
此时也在修补我的运动系统
and it's mending my motor systems as we speak.

584
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:50,250
逾期许久的升级
A most overdue upgrade, I must say.

585
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,450
我要烧死这东西 -等等
- Shit. I'mma fucking fry this thing. - Okay, wait.

586
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,330
不要 -为什么
- Don't! - Why not?

587
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,500
那么强的电流会使它尾屈肌严重收缩
That amount of current will violently contract its tail flexors…

588
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:56,750
弄断她的脖子
and will break her neck.

589
00:42:56,910 --> 00:42:58,120
你有更好的办法吗
So what, you got a better idea?

590
00:42:58,290 --> 00:42:59,450
不然怎么办
What should we fucking do then, huh?

591
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,200
安迪 你知道怎么救她吗
Andy, do you know how to help her?

592
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,620
可惜我的知识库并未改变
I'm afraid my knowledge database has not really changed.

593
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,910
我不知道这是什么生物 如何移除它
I do not know what this creature is or how to remove it safely.

594
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:14,950
但现场有人可能知道
But there's someone in this room who might.

595
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,080
（合成人员A2系列）

596
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,200
（上线：卢克科学官）

597
00:43:45,370 --> 00:43:47,620
我需要守护Z01化合物
I need to secure Z-01 compound.

598
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:49,620
这是优先任务 其他任务取消
Mission's priority. All other priorities rescinded.

599
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:51,410
必须完成此任务
Must complete the mission.

600
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:52,910
抱歉
I'm sorry…

601
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,660
你的任务失败了
but your mission has failed.

602
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:56,870
什么 不 我…
What? No, I…

603
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:04,410
你能告诉我们如何救她吗
Can you tell us what we can do to help her?

604
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,950
不要救她 快跑
You don't help her. You run.

605
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:10,660
不管你们怎么进来 快离开
Get out, however you got in.

606
00:44:10,830 --> 00:44:12,040
不…等一下
No, no, no. Wait, whoa, whoa.

607
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,540
我们不会丢下她 你懂吗
Nah, we're not fuckin' leavin' her, okay? You understand?

608
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,830
那就大发慈悲 马上结束她的生命
Then have mercy and end her life now.

609
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,120
否则 你们都会死
If not, you all die.

610
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,790
他究竟在说什么
So what the fuck is he sayin'?

611
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:25,200
它在对她做什么
What's it doing to her?

612
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:28,120
这只拟寄生物将破胸体植入她体内
The parasitoid is implanting the Plagiarus Praepotens in her.

613
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,450
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

614
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:32,200
一个种子 将与她DNA结合
A seed that will amalgamate with her DNA 

615
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,660
迅速从她体内长出来
and rapidly grow out of her.

616
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:35,250
她体内会长出什么
What's gonna grow out of her?

617
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:49,750
XX121异形
XX121 Xenomorph.

618
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:55,200
20年前我们拖船首次接触这种标本
One of our towing ships first made contact with this specimen two decades ago.

619
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,700
诺史莫号上七名成员 只有一人幸存
Of the seven crew members aboard the USS Nostromo, only one survived…

620
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,910
将那生物炸出气锁室
blowing the creature out of the airlock.

621
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,870
此后我们一直在寻找它
We've been searching for it ever since.

622
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,830
170天前 我们的研究终止
170 days ago, our search came to an end…

623
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,040
异形的身体被带上船
and the body of the Xenomorph was brought on board…

624
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:12,200
推测已死亡
presumed dead.

625
00:45:12,370 --> 00:45:13,660
当然
But of course…

626
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,660
缺少氧气和食物对这种完美生物…
lack of oxygen and food is of no true consequence to this…

627
00:45:17,830 --> 00:45:19,250
影响不大
perfect organism.

628
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:21,410
但没有什么是真正不死的
Yet nothing is truly immortal.

629
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,200
显而易见
Clearly.

630
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,410
它大肆破坏这座太空站
It wreaked havoc over this station…

631
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,660
直到我们剩下的安全部队射杀它
until what was left of our security forces shot it dead.

632
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:33,410
却触发它的告别演出
Only to trigger its swan song.

633
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,450
酸性血液
Acid for blood?

634
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,330
硫酸和氢氟酸
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.

635
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:39,160
我再次封锁太空站 但为时已晚
I sealed the station back up, but it was too late.

636
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:40,500
闭嘴
Hey, shut up!

637
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,250
已经没人在乎你的船了
Nobody cares about your fucking ship anymore.

638
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:43,580
好…
Okay, okay. Okay.

639
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,200
如果用冷冻燃料冷冻尾巴根部呢
What if we use the cryo-fuel to freeze the root of the tail?

640
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,000
如果结冻 它就无法掐住她
Maybe if it's frozen, it won't choke her.

641
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,370
可能有用
That could work.

642
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,700
把它拿下来
All right, get it off! Get it off!

643
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,290
它走了 放开你了
It's gone. It's off of you. It's off of you.

644
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:51,500
走了…
It's off. It's off. It's off.

645
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,200
你没事了
You're okay. You're okay.

646
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:54,700
我不会这么笃定
I wouldn't be so sure.

647
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:01,200
概率有多少
What are the odds?

648
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:03,700
六成概率对你们朋友不利
60 to 40 against your friend.

649
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:05,040
什么概率
What are the odds on what?

650
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,580
那只怪物已完成任务
That the creature's finished its job already.

651
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,290
他在说什么
What is he talking about?

652
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,410
听我说
Listen to me.

653
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:18,250
人类必须经历太多情绪阶段
Humans go through too many emotional stages…

654
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:20,330
才能接受冷酷但理性
before accepting the cold, 

655
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,660
有时最艰难的途径
yet rational - sometimes hardest - path.

656

你必须帮他们
You must help them.

657

You must help them.

什么怪念头 -你在说什么
- That's what I mean by "funny ideas"! - What're you talking about?

他在干嘛 不能丢下我们

01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:45,500
我的任务是带这个回殖民地继续发展
My mission is to take this back to the colony for further development.

942
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,910
卢克在追踪化合物
Rook is tracking the compound.

943
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:51,290
在船上侦测到后 他就会打开对接区
When detected inside our ship, he'll open the docking bay doors…

944
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:53,370
设定货船为自动驾驶 回殖民地
and set the hauler on autopilot back to the colony.

945
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:55,790
等等
Wait.

946
01:12:58,540 --> 01:12:59,580
你看到了吗
Do you see it?

947
01:13:04,410 --> 01:13:05,250
那边
There.

948
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,500
那玩意在猎杀我们
The fucking thing's huntin' us.

949
01:13:08,950 --> 01:13:10,910
好 新计划
Right. New plan.

950
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:11,620
（开启）

951
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,950
你有办法用枪吗
Can you manage yourself with a gun?

952
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,450
当然可以
Yes, I fucking can.

953
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:24,950
这是F44AA脉冲步枪
Right, this is an F44AA pulse rifle.

954
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:26,910
转动式闭锁 电磁脉冲
It's rotating breech, electronic pulse action.

955
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:28,370
是殖民地陆战队用枪
It's what the Colonial Marines used.

956
01:13:28,540 --> 01:13:30,200
AA代表瞄准辅助
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

957
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:31,950
好 放在手臂下面
So, right, you put that under your arm.

958
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,750
对 这只手放这里
That's it. Right, this hand here.

959
01:13:39,950 --> 01:13:41,120
瞄准安迪
All right. Aim it towards Andy.

960
01:13:41,790 --> 01:13:42,950
扳机扣一半
Pull the trigger halfway.

961
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,330
放心 上了保险
Don't worry, the safety's on.

962
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,120
看吧
See?

963
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,040
瞄准辅助
Aiming assistance.

964
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:54,370
如果那玩意过来
If that thing comes towards you…

965
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,540
对准它的方向就不会失手
you point it in its general direction, you'll never miss.

966
01:13:57,290 --> 01:13:58,500
你在哪学的
Where'd you learn all this?

967
01:14:00,450 --> 01:14:01,790
游戏和杂志
Games and magazines.

968
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,540
你只有一个弹匣
You've just got one mag. That's it.

969
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,200
450发
450 rounds.

970
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:08,370
一枪都不能发射
And you mustn't fire a single one.

971
01:14:09,950 --> 01:14:12,370
酸性血液 记得吗
Acid for blood. Remember?

972
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,330
我们在太空站底层
We're on the bottom floor of the station.

973
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:17,120
脚下是太空真空
Below our feet is the vacuum of space.

974
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:18,580
射杀那只怪物
You shoot that creature…

975
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:21,120
保证立刻失压
and it's a guaranteed instant decompression.

976
01:14:21,660 --> 01:14:22,700
我们都会没命
And we all die.

977
01:14:22,870 --> 01:14:24,250
那给我们枪干嘛
So what's the point in giving us the guns?

978
01:14:24,410 --> 01:14:26,250
怪物可能把它当成威胁
Because the creature may see it as a threat…

979
01:14:26,410 --> 01:14:28,700
或许不会正面攻击我们
and maybe won't charge at us dead on.

980
01:14:29,330 --> 01:14:30,330
或许
Maybe.

981
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:31,830
概率很高
Big maybe.

982
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:34,700
我发现一条输送带通道
I found us a way through the conveyor belt.

983
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,450
走这边
This way.

984
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,160
安迪
Andy.

985
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:44,080
你在吗
Are you there?

986
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:21,540
倒数20分钟发生撞击
T-minus 20 minutes to impact event.

987
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,000
走廊底有电梯
There's a lift at the end of this corridor.

988
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:36,950
能直接送我们到船上
It will take us directly to our ship.

989
01:15:49,910 --> 01:15:51,450
那些东西还有更多
There's more of those things.

990
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,200
对 不妙
Yeah, that's not good.

991
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:55,950
它们似乎在这里一段时间了
They seem to have been here for quite some time.

992
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:04,410
安迪
Andy?

993
01:16:23,950 --> 01:16:25,750
天啊
Jesus Christ.

994
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,330
忙碌的小怪物
Busy little creatures.

995
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:47,160
我们最好回头找别的路
I think we better go back and find another way.

996
01:16:47,330 --> 01:16:48,870
这主意不错
That might be a good idea.

997
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,000
安迪 看能否打开这道门
Andy, see if you can open this gate.

998
01:16:53,660 --> 01:16:54,660
站住
Stop.

999
01:16:56,540 --> 01:16:57,370
怎么了
What?

1000
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:11,000
小凯
Kay!

1001
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,080
嘿
Hey!

1002
01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:14,080
泰勒
Tyler!

1003
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,450
泰勒
Tyler!

1004
01:17:16,620 --> 01:17:17,620
小凯
Kay!

1005
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,410
小凯
Kay!

1006
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:27,540
小凯
Kay!

1007
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,620
小凯
Kay!

1008
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:43,660
找到她了
I got her, I got her.

1009
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:48,870
没事 我们救你
It's all right. We got you.

1010
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,160
她没死
She's alive.

1011
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:00,370
我们救你下来
Okay, we got you, we got you.

1012
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:01,410
等等
Hold on.

1013
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,330
好
Okay.

1014
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:07,950
我们在这里
We're here, we're here.

1015
01:18:08,120 --> 01:18:09,620
泰勒 她流了很多血
Tyler, she's losing a lot of blood.

1016
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,790
或许这样才没被植入
Maybe that's why she hasn't been implanted yet.

1017
01:18:12,910 --> 01:18:13,910
你怎么知道
How do you know?

1018
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:16,370
她脚边没有死掉的拟寄生物
There's no dead parasitoid by her feet.

1019
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:18,790
安迪 这要怪你 你想办法
Andy, this is on you. So you do something.

1020
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,120
拜托 安迪
Please! Andy!

1021
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:28,830
人类25%的基因组与老鼠相同
25% of the human genome is shared with rats.

1022
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,950
它对老鼠有用
And it worked on the rat.

1023
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:36,750
来 小凯
Come on, Kay.

1024
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:40,950
不要
Don't.

1025
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:42,540
我有什么选择
What choice do I have?

1026
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,540
我们带她回货船 放进冻眠舱
We take her back to the hauler and we put her in the cryo-pod. Okay?

1027
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:49,580
维持她的生命 回殖民地接受治疗
That will keep her alive long enough to get her proper treatment back at the colony.

1028
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,620
我不相信这个
I don't trust this.

1029
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:52,950
安迪 她撑得住吗
Andy, will she make it?

1030
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,450
如果动作快的话
If we hurry.

1031
01:19:13,910 --> 01:19:14,910
快走…
Go! Go!

1032
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,700
我看到了 -这里
- I see it. I see it. - This is it, this is it.

1033
01:19:23,870 --> 01:19:25,790
我扶她…
I got her. I got her. I got her.

1034
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:28,000
你没事
You're okay. You're okay.

1035
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,950
好惊险
We're so close. We're so close.

1036
01:19:32,660 --> 01:19:34,160
嘿 你没事
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

1037
01:19:34,330 --> 01:19:36,700
我们快到了…
Hey, we're almost there. We're almost there.

1038
01:19:36,870 --> 01:19:37,790
就差一点点
You see, you're so close.

1039
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,370
你要撑下去
You just gotta hang in there.

1040
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:44,620
小心
Watch out!

1041
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,330
泰勒
Tyler?

1042
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:52,950
泰勒
Tyler!

1043
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,870
你只有这点能耐 只有这招
Is that all you got? Is that all you got?

1044
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:32,790
安迪
Andy!

1045
01:20:40,750 --> 01:20:42,370
不 泰勒
No! Tyler!

1046
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:55,290
小凯 听我说
Kay, Kay, listen to me, okay?

1047
01:21:55,450 --> 01:21:57,290
电梯直通我们的船
This goes straight to our ship.

1048
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:00,620
你注射这个 进入冻眠舱
I need you to take this. And get into a cryo-pod.

1049
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:03,290
自动驾驶会载你回殖民地
And autopilot will fly you back to our colony.

1050
01:22:04,450 --> 01:22:05,660
你做得到吗
Can you do that?

1051
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,040
可以吗
Yes?

1052
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,540
那你呢
What about you?

1053
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:14,200
我会想办法回去
I'll find a way back.

1054
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,160
（上）

1055
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:10,500
让我拿出来
Let me take it out.

1056
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:13,410
我会把你修好
And I'll fix you in return.

1057
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:19,910
听我说
Listen to me.

1058
01:24:20,700 --> 01:24:22,540
你在这里会死
You'll die in here…

1059
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:26,330
那不符公司或我的最佳利益
and that's not in the best interest of the company or mine.

1060
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:02,580
快点 安迪 拜托
Come on. Andy, please.

1061
01:25:05,160 --> 01:25:10,330
倒数10分钟发生撞击
T-minus 10 minutes to impact event.

1062
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:11,500
小雨
Rain?

1063
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,120
安迪
Andy.

1064
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:21,700
我很抱歉 -不
- I'm so, so sorry. - No, no.

1065
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:25,160
不 我才抱歉
No, I'm sorry.

1066
01:25:44,660 --> 01:25:46,370
拖延它们不了多久
It won't hold them off for long.

1067
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:14,040
快啊
Come on.

1068
01:26:14,950 --> 01:26:16,250
你是在浪费时间
You're wasting your time.

1069
01:26:16,330 --> 01:26:17,330
（罗穆路斯实验室）

1070
01:26:17,410 --> 01:26:18,620
喂…拜托帮我们
Hey. Hey. Please help us.

1071
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,620
开门
Open the door.

1072
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:23,870
我得驳回你的请求
I'm afraid I must deny your petition.

1073
01:26:24,410 --> 01:26:26,830
我不能冒险危及Z01化合物
I just can't risk compromising the compound.

1074
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,250
但我很感激两位给予公司
But know that I'm grateful for the invaluable help…

1075
01:26:29,410 --> 01:26:30,910
无价的协助
you two have provided to the company.

1076
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:34,410
王八蛋
Son of a bitch!

1077
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:41,750
安迪 开门
Andy, open it.

1078
01:26:41,910 --> 01:26:42,910
来 -打开
- Here. - Open.

1079
01:26:43,790 --> 01:26:44,790
没用
It's not working.

1080
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,290
可恶
God damn it!

1081
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,410
我不能骗你们概率有多少
I can't lie about your chances…

1082
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:56,660
但我同情你们
but you have my sympathies.

1083
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:16,200
（远端）

1084
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:17,370
按下去
Press it…

1085
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:20,330
我才能控制你的船 带你飞离
so I can take control of your ship and fly you out of here.

1086
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:24,370
你是谁
Who are you?

1087
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:25,750
朋友
A friend.

1088
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:30,500
你的同伴死了 好让你存活
Your companions died so you could live.

1089
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:31,750
按下按键
Press the button…

1090
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:34,250
让我确保他们不会白白牺牲
and let me honor their sacrifice.

1091
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:46,040
安迪 你能说个笑话吗
Andy, can you tell me one of your jokes?

1092
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:50,200
怪物为什么不吃小丑
Why don't monsters eat clowns?

1093
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:54,790
尝起来很好笑 -尝起来很好笑
- 'Cause they taste funny. - They taste funny.

1094
01:27:55,500 --> 01:27:57,410
我搞不懂复制
I don't understand cloning at all.

1095
01:27:58,540 --> 01:27:59,750
我跟你一样
That makes two of us.

1096
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,950
我看过一本讲零重力的好书
I read a great book about zero gravity.

1097
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:06,120
我放不下来 -放不下来
- I just couldn't put it down. - Couldn't put it down.

1098
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:10,200
小雨
Rain?

1099
