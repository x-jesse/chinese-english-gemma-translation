1
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:17,950
好了
Well, 

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,330
现在全玩完了
it's all going to shit.

3
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,540
炼金男爵一个一个的都想控制黑巷
Chembarons warring for control of the Lanes.

4
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,080
地痞混混因为一口剩饭都能打起来
Wannabe street thugs squabbling over scraps.

5
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,410
就像范德尔没了的时候一样
Just like when Vander shoved off.

6
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,290
只是这次
Except this time...

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,370
你不能出来主持大局了
you aren't here to put it all back together, 

8
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:42,950
因为...
because...

9
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,950
你已经被我打成筛子了
Because someone put all those holes in you.

10
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,910
蔚总说我什么都能修得好
Vi used to say I could fix anything.

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,040
而我却把一切都毁了
Before I broke everything.

12
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,660
她还说过好多话
She used to say a lot.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,160
你跟她一样
Her and you.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,910
你们总对我呼来喝去的
Always bossing me around.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,870
如今倒是清净了
Now it's so quiet.

16
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,500
我反倒不适应了
What am I supposed to do with that?

17
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,200
你受够了没有
Have you had enough?

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,250
{\an8}《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第二集

19
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,250
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

20
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,250
你能懂吗
You feel it?

21
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,830
脑子里
That...

22
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:05,370
不停地响个没完
...buzzing behind your eyes?

23
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:10,250
但只要轻轻来这么一下 像这样
Because you know, in a moment, it could all... 

24
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,500
砰
poow!

25
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,410
那感觉才叫一个爽
Best feeling in the world, kid.

26
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,120
(金克丝 通缉)

27
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,830
对啊 那是我
Yep, that's me.

28
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,200
你要是哪一天对这个世界 或者亲人厌了 烦了
You ever need to curse a sibling or a family or a society...

29
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,950
找我
my card.

30
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,620
那什么 咱就说 就事论事啊
Well, you know, far be it from me, 

31
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,080
就是您雇我 是要我来管账
but, uh, you hired me to run the numbers.

32
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,700
可自打咱们跟其他炼金男爵杠上之后
And ever since we've gone up against the other chembarons,

33
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,910
- 账面就变得... - 更难看了
- the numbers are in the, uh... - Shitter?

34
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:00,540
倒也不是更难看了
Not exactly the term I...

35
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,080
知道你这种动脑子的
Ever wonder why fat brains 

36
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,750
为什么最后要给动拳头的干活吗
like you always wind up working for grunts like me?

37
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,500
不 不知道
No, uh, never.

38
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,620
你们的脑子只动了一半
You only use half your head.

39
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,250
出出主意啊
Plotting moves.

40
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,540
计算计算结果啊
Calculating odds.

41
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,370
希尔科凭什么能拿下黑巷
Know how Silco took hold of the Lanes?

42
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,200
凭的是拳头够硬
With his bare teeth.

43
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,950
可是 现在出拳是不是有点草率
It just, you know, seems, uh, hasty.

44
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:23,370
玛戈的老巢少说也得有十个打手坐镇
Last count, Margot had at least ten hitters guarding the stash.

45
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,790
玛戈和克罗斯随便怎么折腾
Margot and Chross can buck all they want, but in the end,

46
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:28,330
反正最终都是我笑到最后
I'll be the one smiling.

47
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,620
在我当上老大之前 你就管一样
Until I'm in Silco's chair, your only job 

48
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,160
就是保证咱们有钱花
is to make the numbers work, hmm?

49
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,790
灰瘴都进到这儿了
The Grey. All the way up here?

50
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,540
你懂个屁
What do you know? 

51
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,790
灰瘴清了场
Cleared the place out.

52
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,910
那咱们反倒还省事儿了
Might have made our jobs a lot easier.

53
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,700
别 别去
No, no, no. We can't.

54
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,790
不过就是地下工厂的废气嘛
It's factory smog trapped underground.

55
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,830
- 瞧把你给吓得 - 老大
- No more, no less. - Boss.

56
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,040
你先进去 看看情况
You-- You go on ahead. Report back.

57
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,700
我
Me?

58
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,290
我知道你们都在盘算着 怎么怎么锯掉另外几个人的脑袋
I know you're all fantasizing about sawing each other's heads off.

59
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,750
那干脆我就直说了吧
So I'm gonna get right to it.

60
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,200
现在不是争地盘的时候
These turf wars have to stop.

61
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,370
是他们两个先挑事儿的
These two have been the aggressors. 

62
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,790
我不过是正当防卫
I've only defended my interests.

63
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,700
你可别在这装模作样了
Playing coy doesn't suit you, love.

64
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,250
也不知道是谁先突袭升天走廊的
You started this dance when you raided the Rapturewalk.

65
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,950
我要你那条破烂大街干什么
What could I want with your boulevard of filth?

66
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,120
咱们的敌人是上城
Topside is the real enemy.

67
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,000
这时候他们就希望看到咱们自相残杀
Us killing each other is playing right into their hands.

68
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,620
你们那些纠缠不清的恩怨 能不能先放一放
Our best shot is to put aside these petty squabbles

69
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,080
大家联手御敌
and join forces.

70
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,910
跟他们俩联手
Ally with these two? 

71
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,750
我宁可一个人跟上城拼一拼
I rather favor my chances with Topside.

72
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,910
就算联手
Even together, 

73
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,290
我们的人也比上城少得多
they outnumber us four to one.

74
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,580
算上这阵子死伤的就更少了
That's before all the recent casualties.

75
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,450
虽然他们人多
Might matter up there,

76
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,910
但是在裂沟作战
but they don't know the first thing 

77
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,120
输赢可就不一定了
about fighting in the fissures.

78
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:45,450
他没死吧
Is he dead?

79
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,040
怎么一直不吭声啊
Why is he so quiet?

80
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,750
她说得对
She's right.

81
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:54,910
只有拔掉上城这根刺才能安宁
We don't get Topside off our backs, we don't last.

82
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,830
不过我有我的想法
But I got a different solution.

83
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,540
把金克丝交出来
We give them Jinx.

84
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
问题就解决了
It's all they really want.

85
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,160
(金克丝 皮尔特沃夫 通缉)

86
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,580
我们不能把自己人交出去
We don't hand over our people.

87
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,580
我们  你也就剩张嘴能动了还代表我们
"We"? You don't do much of anything anymore, do you, magpie?

88
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,250
那掉了毛的凤凰可不如鸡啊
Bird without a wing's just a funny-looking rat.

89
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,790
被说中了 是不是啊
Struck a nerve, did I?

90
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,790
行了 咱们做笔生意
Okay, I'll make you a deal.

91
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:22,250
你替我帮咱们上城的朋友 找到那蓝发小妞
You help me put a bow on Baby Blue for our friends upstairs,

92
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,250
我就给你弄个新机械手臂
I'll cut you a brand-new puncher, 

93
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,040
配置什么的 都是最尖儿的
top of the line, all the fixings.

94
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,500
考虑考虑 但我先说好
Think on it. But I promise,

95
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,450
你可就这么一次机会
it's the last offer you're gonna get.

96
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,870
为什么你人都死了
I can't believe you're dead 

97
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,580
我还得继续为你收拾烂摊子
and I'm still mopping up your messes.

98
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,620
大姐 你没病吧
Jeez, lady, you crazy?

99
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,450
跟死人说话呢
Talking to dead people.

100
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,580
你是来给我个了断的吗
You here to finish me off?

101
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,410
嫌我照顾你的还不够啊
Haven't I done you enough favors?

102
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,660
每天这个时候
Same time every day.

103
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,580
多大的人了 自己还搞不定
Big baby couldn't do it himself.

104
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,660
他也不用亲自上手
- Couldn't do much himself. - Mm.

105
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,660
每天一到这个时候 就会派我去黑巷替他收账
About now, he'd have me all over the Lanes running his collections.

106
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,330
替他造武器
Building his weapons.

107
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:10,700
替他谈生意
Making his deals.

108
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,200
替他炸飞他的仇家
Exploding his enemies.

109
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,080
他人不在了
He dips out,

110
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,200
整个世界也一团乱
the whole world flips over.

111
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
他的抱负
All his plans.

112
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,830
我们建立起来的一切
Everything we built.

113
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
现在到底要怎么办才好
The hell we supposed to do now?

114
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,450
任它化为灰烬
Watch it all burn.

115
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:01,580
我说什么来着
What'd I tell you?

116
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,830
维克托
Viktor.

117
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,290
维克托
Viktor.

118
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:26,450
维克托
Viktor! Viktor... Viktor!

119
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,160
杰斯
Jayce?

120
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:21,750
维克托
Viktor?

121
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,580
我的天
My God.

122
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,500
我是怎么了
What... am I?

123
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,120
你...
You're...

124
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,250
你没事了
You're alive.

125
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,370
你没事了
You're-- You're alive.

126
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,830
你身上冷不冷
You must be cold.

127
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,160
冷...
Cold.

128
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,200
不 并不冷
No, I don't think so.

129
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:57,950
感觉像被能量充斥
I sense a charge.

130
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,330
像能量场 循环的脉冲
A potential. A recursive impulse.

131
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,080
不舒服 但不能用冷形容
Unpleasant, but... "cold" isn't its name.

132
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,450
是海克斯核心...
The Hexcore.

133
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,200
维克托它救了你
Viktor, it saved you.

134
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,000
不知怎么 它跟你融为一体
Somehow it-- It adapted to your injuries,

135
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,660
不断地改变 进化
changing and evolving.

136
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,450
感觉你们心灵相通了
It was as if it was connected to you.

137
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,540
我参照了你治腿的笔记
I did my best using the notes from your leg. 

138
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,040
能记的也都记了
Recorded everything.

139
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,540
还有很多疑问 不过...
There are still so many questions, but--

140
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,870
我应该死掉的
I was supposed to die.

141
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,200
你答应销毁海克斯核心的
You promised to destroy the Hexcore.

142
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,040
不 你不明白吗
No. Don't you see?

143
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,040
黑默丁格错了
Heimerdinger was wrong.

144
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,950
我们都错了
We were wrong. 

145
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,870
它并没有那么可怕...
It's not as bad as we--

146
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:43,160
它害死了斯凯 杰斯
It killed Sky, Jayce.

147
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,080
什么
What?

148
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,830
不
No.

149
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,410
她和我们有着...
She had such dreams.

150
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,450
有着同样的梦想
As did we once.

151
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,370
我打算去向议会递辞呈
I'm going to resign from the Council.

152
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,370
现在我明白了
I understand now.

153
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,790
我就应该在这里
My place was always here 

154
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,870
在实验室跟你一起
in the lab with you.

155
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,080
咱们一起努力 都会好的
We'll make this right. Together.

156
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:19,120
我必须与你和这个地方道别了 杰斯
I must say goodbye to this place now. To you.

157
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,200
道别
Goodbye?

158
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,830
维克托 我们是搭档
Viktor, you're my partner.

159
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,910
你我早就分道扬镳了
Our paths diverged long ago.

160
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,000
只不过基于友谊
It was affection 

161
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,750
才走到今天
that held us together.

162
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,870
你以为我好受吗
You think it's so easy?

163
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,250
背负着全城人寄予的厚望却置之不理
To turn your back while your city looks to you for salvation?

164
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,830
眼看着好友命悬一线却心有余悸
To cling to principles while your best friend bleeds out 

165
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,500
不敢放手相救
in your arms?

166
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,160
我就该承受这些吗
I never asked for this.

167
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,750
你要上哪儿去
Where are you going?

168
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,200
再见了 杰斯
Goodbye, Jayce.

169
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,000
人越来越多了
There's so many of them.

170
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,790
帮派火拼
It's all the fighting. 

171
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,290
这里装不下多少人了
We're gonna have capacity issues soon.

172
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,580
而且还有安全隐患
Then there's the security risk.

173
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,200
那也不能把他们拒之门外
We're not turning people away.

174
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,620
这么多年
All these years, 

175
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,950
好不容易摆脱了希尔科
we finally get rid of Silco,

176
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,000
结果却是换个人继续走老路
just so a new one can take his place.

177
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,500
看好了
Now watch this.

178
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,870
这可真让人头大啊
Oh, this is quite troubling.

179
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,910
那棵树对我们来说非常重要
That tree means so much.

180
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:01,790
我们的食物 新鲜的空气
It's our food. Fresh air. 

181
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,450
我们生存的一切都来自于它We built our whole identity around it.

182
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,620
每次以为能松口气的时候就会...
Every time it seems like we might catch a break...

183
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,290
好啦 总会有办法的嘛
Ah, now, it's not lost yet, lad.

184
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,410
要是有法子救这棵树
If there is a means of preservation, 

185
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,620
祖师爷啊 我们一定能找到的
by golly, we'll find it.

186
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,330
这种状态的东西我以前见过
I have seen something of this nature before.

187
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,750
去去去
Ch-ch-ch.

188
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,830
这里
Hmm.

189
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,160
你不是说是你的地盘吗
Don't you essentially own this place?

190
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,870
嘘
Shh.

191
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,910
跟我来
Come on.

192
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,370
红霸符已经离开野区
The brambleback has left the jungle.

193
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,370
你难道不知道这样现编暗号 别人是听不懂的吗
Uh, you do realize code phrases don't work when you make them up on the spot?

194
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,410
教授
Professor?

195
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,790
对啊 不然呢
Yes, of course.

196
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:47,080
你这是搞什么名堂啊你
What the devil's gotten into you?

197
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,000
我还以为...
I thought...

198
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,450
你闯进我的实验室干吗
Why are you breaking into my lab?

199
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,200
他又是谁
And who's he?

200
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,370
他是我新收的学生艾克
This is my new pupil, Ekko.

201
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:00,290
艾克 这是我以前的学生杰斯
Ekko, my former pupil Jayce.

202
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,950
我很抱歉突然造访
I apologize for the intrusion.

203
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,910
我们本打算悄悄溜进来的
We were attempting to sneak in.

204
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,290
得了吧 就好像你没干过似的
Oh, pishposh. Like you've never done it.

205
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,540
你是住在这儿了吗
Were you sleeping here?

206
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,290
要不要来杯茶 艾克
You drink tea, Ekko?

207
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,910
没错
You're right.

208
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,580
腐蚀情况跟用海克斯核心 测试的植物一致
It matches the corruption we saw on the plants we tested with the Hexcore, 

209
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,370
不过你们是在哪儿发现的来着
but where did you say you found this?

210
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,950
就在我们底城深处
Deep in the underground.

211
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:44,580
艾克的家乡是个不同寻常的地方
Ekko's home is a marvelous place.

212
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,750
惊为天人
Truly a wonder.

213
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,330
你真该去看看的
- You should see what-- -  Hey.

214
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:52,540
对 我说的家乡 当然是指他心灵的归属
Uh, right, uh, when I said "home," I was, of course, referring to his cognitive center.

215
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,830
反正肯定不可能 是什么真实存在的地方
Not a physical location hidden in the...

216
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,750
黑默丁格
Heimer, 

217
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,200
- 而且更不可能还藏在... - 你说什么呢
what are you doing?

218
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,290
植物有存活下来的吗
Did any of the plants survive?

219
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,330
当时都没有顾得上考虑
They weren't what we were trying to save.

220
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,700
但这个纹路
But this pattern.

221
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,790
怎么可能两个城都有出现
How could it be there and here?

222
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,290
不是吧
Oh, no.

223
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,200
维克托去哪儿了
Where's Viktor?

224
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,580
臭小子往哪跑

225
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,700
找死吗你

226
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,160
老实点儿

227
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,160
滚一边儿去

228
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,950
记住了吗

229
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,450
维克托
Viktor.

230
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,540
维克托
Viktor.

231
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,290
确定没人
It's all clear.

232
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,080
抱歉 长官
Sorry, commander.

233
00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:33,120
蓝发小妞
Baby Blue.

234
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,370
你还真是难逮啊
Right through their fingers.

235
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,410
你是属泥鳅的吧
You must be part eel.

236
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:40,160
这回我可得狮子大开口了
Just means I can up my finder's fee.

237
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,500
有商有量才叫生意嘛
There's always a deal to be struck.

238
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,580
别动 他们是要留活口
Ah, ah, ah. They want you alive.

239
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,750
可没说不能把你的眼珠子挖出来
But don't think I won't skewer out those peepers.

240
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,830
看你这种长手的该怎么办
Drawback of you long-range types.

241
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,830
我呢 我比较喜欢靠得近一点
Me? I'm the kind of guy who likes to get in close.

242
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,330
没想到你还会哭鼻子
Never thought I'd catch you blubbering.

243
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,830
希尔科见没见过你这个样子
Wonder if Silco even saw that.

244
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,910
两回
Twice.

245
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,500
一回是刚见面
When he met me

246
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,370
一回是我杀了他
and when I killed him.

247
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,040
是你
You?

248
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,660
回回都是我
It's always me.

249
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,040
就算不是我动的手
Whether I'm pulling the pin or not,

250
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:16,040
但凡有人靠近我的身边 也都得死
everyone who gets close to me dies.

251
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,290
明白我的意思了吧
Wanna know the real kicker?

252
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:24,870
你不是说你还是喜欢靠得近一点吗
You're the kind of guy who likes to get in close.

253
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,450
慢着 慢着
Okay, wait, wait, wait. There's a deal to be struck here.

254
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,000
做生意得有商有量的

255
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,290
提醒你一下 你可就那么一次机会
You forget, Smeech? You already made your last offer.

256
00:31:15,410 --> 00:31:18,660
你说凤凰掉了毛不如什么来着
Tell me, who's a funny-looking rat now?

257
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,540
你怎么会来这儿
Fancy meeting you here.

258
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,500
这蠢货永远都管不住自己那张臭嘴
Moron never could keep his damn mouth shut.

259
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,040
干嘛不让我自生自灭
You could've just let me eat it.

260
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,080
嫌我照顾你的还不够啊
Haven't I done you enough favors?

261
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,000
我没让你做这个
I didn't ask you for this.

262
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,750
这些不过就是顺手的事
It was something I could fix.

263
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,790
你又是一副那种表情
You got that look in your eye again.

264
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:07,370
在打什么主意
What are you planning?

265
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,870
有些家里的事情需要了结
To finish what's left of my family.

266
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,330
维克托
Viktor.

267
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:39,750
维克托
Viktor.

268
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,540
小心别把装备刮坏了
Careful not to scrape up the gear.

269
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,120
不然就卖不出去了
Won't sell as well.

270
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:07,290
我也不想伤害你
Nothing personal, friend.

271
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,580
我们实在也是没有办法
We just got needs we can't ignore.

272
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,870
这种痛苦毫无意义
So much senseless pain.

273
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,200
你想干什么
What are you doing?

274
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:55,410
你们不必再受苦了
You need not suffer anymore.

275
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,370
可是
But...

276
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,330
