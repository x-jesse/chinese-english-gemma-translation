You'd better come clean with them.

我就是县长夫人啊
I'm the Governor's wife.

50
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,670

有钱！有钱…！

53
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,660
我跟县长进城上任
We're on our way to inauguration.

54
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,150
县长淹死了 现在没有
He ruined it all by getting drowned!

55
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,990
上任就有！上任就有钱
But we can still hit jackpot

56
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,670
上任就有！
if we take his vacant post.

57
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,790
再给你一圈 顺着买官往下说
I'll give you another chance. Tell me more.

半年半年！手气好 一个月也行！

67
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,430
你一个师爷敢冒充县长？
You dare to impersonate the Governor?

68
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,630
没人认识县长长什么模样
They've never met him.

69
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,150
-你干过几次？     -一年两次

他 他县长赚过六百四十万！

73

我不是师爷么 我就赚个零头！
I only get the small change.

74
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,030
没失过手？
Ever failed?

75
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,190
不动手 拼的是脑子 不流血
We use our brains, not brawn.

76
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,670
你这次去哪儿上任？
Where are you heading to?

77
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,950
鹅城
Goose Town.

78
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,110
火车被劫 你的人淹死了怎么交代？
How do you explain the hold-up and the bodies?

79
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,660
车是我买的 人是我雇的 没人追查
I bought the train and hired the soldiers.

80
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,190
没有人追查
No one will ever find out.

81
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,350
别摘！别摘…！千万别摘！
Don't take it off! Leave your mask on!

82
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,150

看见你的脸我就活不成

85
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,350
赚了钱 都给你！都给你！

86

弟兄们劫回道
We came to rob a train,

87
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,750

we can't go empty-handed.

88
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,510
不合适
No, you can't.

89
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,980
你看了我一眼小命就丢了 也不合适吧
If you die for peeking at me...

90
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,420
更不合适
That's even worse.

91
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,390
你那些淹死的兄弟给我用用？
Can I borrow those bodies?

92
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,190
用！...他们欺男霸女 死有余辜！
Yes. These bullies deserve no better.

93
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,110
不是 死了有什么用啊？
But what do you want to do with them?

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,510
死人有时候比活人有用
They can be more useful than the living.

95
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,030
师爷 睁开眼看我一眼
Take a look at me.

96
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,630
看一眼

99
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,150
姓什么？姓汤

100
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,830

and you'll be my counselor!

102
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,580
咱们鹅城走一趟
Let's go and rule Goose Town.

103
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,550
夫人 要不要走一趟？
Ma'am, coming with us?

104
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,350
走就走嘛
Well, why not?

105
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,950
嘿嘿嘿 弟兄们上任鹅城

106
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
上任鹅城！
Goose Town here we come!

107
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,540
兄弟们失了手
We've messed up badly.

108
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,070
让你丈夫横遭了不测
End up drowning your husband.

109
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,540
我很是愧疚
I feel bad about it.

110
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,350
我已经第四次当寡妇了
I've already been widowed four times.

111
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,230
那可千万别第五次哦！
Don't let there be a fifth time, then!

112
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,030
那就要看你的本事了
That's all up to you.

113
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,430
师爷 当夫妻最要紧的是什么？
What's important for a couple?

114
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,590
恩爱！
In love.

115
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,350
听不见 再说一遍
I can't hear you.

116
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,710
恩爱！
In love.

117
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,020
来 见过母亲大人
Six, come greet your Mom.

118
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,390
母亲大人好 小六子有礼了！
I wish you well, Mother.

119
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,590
你出生入死 还带着儿子啊？
You bring your son to battles?

120
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,830
他爹是我的兄弟 阵亡了
His father was a comrade. Died in battle.

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,870
所以他就成了我的儿子
So I adopted him as my god son.

122
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,110
所以呢 你现在就是我的母亲大人！
Now you're my mother.

123
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,260
等这桩买卖做完后
After we're done with Goose Town,

124
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,630
跟我们一块回山里吧
you must come and join our gang.

125
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,910
你可以继续当我的母亲
Then you can continue to play mother.

126
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,910
人往高处走 水往低处流！
One should always aim high.

127
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,270
当惯了县长
After serving as county governor,

128
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,540
再回去当麻匪
I can't return to banditry.

129
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,030
恐怕会有点不习惯吧
I won't be able to handle it.

130
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,990
曾经沧海难为水嘛
Once you've scaled Mount Everest...

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,070
说得好
Such eloquence!

132
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,260
那怎么办啊？
Then what should we do?

133
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,910
「从正面绕回来 让大家乐一乐」
"Bring him back from the front for a laugh!"

134
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,990
怎么办？继续当官呗！
We can continue to be civil servants!

135
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,900
遇事要多动脑筋
Use your brain, not brawn.

136
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,750
先动脑子后动手 明白吗？
Think twice before you make a move.

137
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,060
明白
Got it.

138
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,110
师爷
Counselor!

139
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,310
我们现在是做官的人了
We're government officials now.

140
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,740
不得再有匪气
We can't act like bandits!

141
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,300
师爷 当县长最要紧的是什么？
What is a good governor's virtue?

142
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,790
忍耐！
Forbearance.

143
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,510
"Goose Town"

144
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,990
你逃过一次
You've escaped once.

145
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,350
你要是再敢耍我…
Try this one more time...

146
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,940
明白！脑袋搬家
You'll have me beheaded!

147
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,430
进城
Let's go!

148
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,550
城里的女人就是白啊
City girls are so fair and delicate!

149
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,270
"Wanted, Dead or Alive!"

150
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,110
爹 你看
Pop, look!

151
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,670
他们怎么把你画成这样了！
Look what they've made of you!

152
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,510
越不像越安全
The less it resembles me, the safer I am!

153
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,190
恭迎县长大人！
Welcome, your honour!

158
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,230
黄老爷驾到

159
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,710
黄老爷吉祥！
Greetings to Master Huang!
Good fortune to Master Huang!

160
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
此乃南国一霸黄四郎
Huang Silang is the local godfather.

161
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,430
干的是贩卖人口 倒卖烟土的大生意
Made his fortune from opium and human trafficking.

162
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,550
黄老爷百忙无暇
Master is currently engaged.

163
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,750
特命我黄府大管家胡万！
So he sends his majordomo, Hu Wan!

164
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,790
黄府团练教头武智冲！
And his militia coach, Wu Zhichong!

165
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,430
礼帽 礼貌 欢迎县长！
To welcome you, sir, with his hat!

166
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,750
来者不善啊
Who dares win!

167
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,910
你才是来者
Do you dare?

168
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,670
老爷 来了
He's here, sir.

169
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,670
谁呀？
Who's here?

170
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,550
你自己
Yourself!

171
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,910
黄大爷万寿！
Long live Master Huang!

172
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,540
小的杨万楼 这厢有礼
Greetings from Yang Wanlou!

173
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,710
赝品是个好东西！
A remarkable fake!

174
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,230
赝品是个好东西！
A remarkable fake!

175
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,390
走几步
Take a few steps.

176
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,590
走出个虎虎生风
Walk purposefully.

177
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:31,270
走个虎虎生风
Purposefully...

178
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,510
走出一个一日千里
Walk with spirit.

179
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,390
走个一日千里
Spiritedly...

180
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,590
走出一个恍如隔世
Walk pensively.

181
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,990
走个恍如隔世
Pensively...

182
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,350
你说她怎么不害怕啊？
Why isn't she afraid?

183
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,950
有点傻吧
She must be daft.

184
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,670
为什么要枪毙麻匪？
Know why we shot these bandits?

185
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,750
因为他们抢官车 劫县长！
It's because they ambushed the Governor.

186
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,550
枪毙他们 就是为了让大家明白
Let this be a lesson to all!

187
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,830
对抗官府之下场！
Never mess with the Governor!

188
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,870
县长来了 鹅城太平了！
Hail the Governor!

189
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,110
县长来了 青天就有啦！
Peace and justice is here!

190
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,910
师爷 说得好啊
Great speech!

191
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,660
你记得我跟你说过
Remember what I told you?

192
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,790
有时候死人比活人有用吧
The dead can be really handy.

193
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,750
是 死人是比活人有用
You're absolutely right.

194
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,830
霸气外露！
Such arrogance!

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:34,670
找死！
He's trouble.

196
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,550
刚进城就开枪
A show of force!

197
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,390
这不是二八开能打发走的
This one is a tricky customer!

198
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,030
先发制人？
Should we strike first?

199
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,030
不急
No hurry.

200
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,870
跟他耍耍
Let's toy with him.

201
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,390
不急 跟他耍耍
No hurry, let's toy with him!

202
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,790
算了吧！
Cut it out!

203
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,350
算了！
Cut it out!

204
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,870
算了吧！

205
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,270
算了算了！
Cut it out! Cut it out!

206
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,350
算了吧！
Cut it out...

207
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,830
算了！!
Cut it out!

208
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,950
算了！!
Cut it out!

209
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,590
算你妈的吧！
Cut the bloody hell out!

210
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,270
胡千
Butler!

211
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,630
是 老爷！
Yes sir!

212
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,070
多拔他几颗牙
Take him to the dentist.

213
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,910
跟我一样 全镶成金的
Fix him up with gold teeth like mine.

214
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,060
是
Yes sir!

215
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,070
夫人
Madam!

216
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,630
兄弟我此番
The reason I am here,

217
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,830
只为劫财
is to get rich,

218
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,870
不为劫色
not to get laid.

219
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,550
同床
We share a bed,

220
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,710
但不入身！
but not our dreams.

221
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,510
有枪在此
Here's a pistol.

222
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,390
若是兄弟我…
Just in case,

223
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,710
有冒犯夫人的举动
I overstep my mark,

224
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,750
你可以随时干掉我
shoot me between the eyes.

225
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,230
若是夫人有任何要求
But if you have that urge,

226
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,670
兄弟我…
then yours truly,

227
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,710
也决不推辞
would be happy to oblige.

228
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,590
睡觉
Let's sleep!

229
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,030
一日夫妻百日恩呐
Husband and wife - even for a day...

230
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,270
反正呢 我就想当县长夫人
I've always wanted to be a governor's wife,

231
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,990
谁是县长 我无所谓！
and I don't care who the governor is.

232
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,950
兄弟 别客气嘛
So, brother, be my guest!

233
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:40,910
我客气吗？
Your guest?

234
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,870
客气呀
Go ahead!

235
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,510
这还算客气？
You make me blush!

236
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,990
你太客气啦
Well, do I?

237
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,990
怎么才能不客气啊？
Then I must oblige.

238
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,670
晚了！
We're late!

239
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,590
前几任县长
Previous governors

240
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,990
把鹅城的税 收到九十年以后了
have levied tax for the next 90 years!

241
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,430
也就是西历二零一零年！
So everyone has paid up to 2010!

242
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,990
咱们来错地方了
We've come to the wrong place!

243
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,030
我倒是觉得这个地方不错
I like this town, though.

244
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,030
百姓成穷鬼了 没油水可榨了
But people here have nothing left.

245
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,660
老子从来就没想刮穷鬼的钱
I never take from the poor.

246
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,790
不刮穷鬼的钱你收谁的呀？
Who are your victims, then?

247
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,510
谁有钱赚谁的
The rich, of course.

248
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:10,550
当过县长吗？
Ever been a Governor?

249
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:11,590
没有
No.

250
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,980
我告诉你！
Listen carefully!

251
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,390
县长上任 得巧立名目
You have to devise ways to raise money,

252
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,630
拉拢豪绅 缴税捐款
Make the rich pay first,

253
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,590
他们交了 才能让百姓跟着交钱
townsfolk will follow suit.

254
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,870
得钱之后 豪绅的钱如数奉还
Then reimburse the rich with what they paid,

255
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,420
百姓的钱 三七分成！
and split the rest 30-70!

256
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,750
怎么才七成啊？
We only get 70?

257
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,590
七成是人家的！
No, the rich get 70.

258
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,390
能得三成还得看黄四郎的脸色
We get 30 at Huang's discretion.

259
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,310
谁的脸色？
At whose discretion?

260
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,580
他！
Him.

261
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,390
他？!
Him?

262
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,190
我大老远的来一趟
I come all this way,

263
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,150
就是为了看他的脸色？
only to become his running dog?

264
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,420
对！
Correct.

265
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,150
我好不容易劫了趟火车
It's hard enough robbing your train,

266
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,230
当了县长
and play-act governor.

267
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,740
我还得拉拢豪绅
I still have to play boot-licker to the rich,

268
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,510
还得巧立名目
make up silly excuses,

269
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,750
还得看他的脸色
and do things at his whim.

270
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,550
我不成跪着要饭的了吗？
Doesn't that make me a beggar?

271
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,030
那你要这么说
If you want to put it that way...

272
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,430
买官当县长还真就是跪着要饭的
Many would love to be in your position,

273
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,310
就这 多少人想跪还没这门路呢！
but few could afford to buy a post.

274
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,310
我问问你 我为什么要上山当土匪？
Do you know why I became an outlaw?

275
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,230
我就是腿脚不方便 跪不下去！
It's because my legs are not built for kneeling!

276
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,710
原来你是想站着赚钱啊！
If you want to make money standing tall,

277
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,230
那还是回山里吧
ride back to the mountains.

278
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,750
这我就不明白了
I don't get this.

279
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,590
我已经当了县长了
I am now governor,

280
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,390
怎么还不如个土匪呀？
how can I be worse off than a bandit?

281
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,270
百姓眼里 你是县长
You may be a governor to the townsfolk.

282
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,910
可是黄四郎眼里
But in the eyes of Huang,

283
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,790
你就是跪着要饭的
you're a mere beggar!

284
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,910
赚钱嘛 生意 不寒酸！
This is only business. There is no shame.

285
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,300
寒酸！
The hell there isn't!

286
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,780
很寒酸
It's shameful!

287
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,950
那你是想站着？
Do you prefer to stand tall,

288
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,150
还是想赚钱呢？
or do you want to make money?

289
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,070
我是想站着 还把钱赚了
I want to do both.

290
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,910
赚不成！
No way.

291
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,630
赚不成？
Why not?

292
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,790
赚不成！
It's impossible.

293
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,910
这个能不能赚钱？
Can I make money with this?

294
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,630
能赚 山里
Yes, but only as a bandit.

295
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,510
这个能不能赚钱？
Or with this?

296
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,430
能赚 跪着
Yes, but only on your knees.

297
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,390
这个加上这个
Combining the two,

298
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,270
能不能站着把钱赚了？
can I make money standing tall?

299
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,110
敢问九筒大哥何方神圣？
Mr. Nine, who exactly are you?

300
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,150
鄙人 张麻子！
"Pocky" Zhang!

301
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,030
那不是树 别砍了！
Stop it! This is not a tree!

302
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,230
这是冤鼓 乾隆那时候设的
It's an ancient magisterial drum!

303
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,550
老没人敲就生了根 长了叶
Totally neglected,

304
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,830
就成现在这样了
it's taken root and sprouted leaves.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,110
我爹说了
Pop said to me,

306
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,190
有冤鼓 就说明有冤！
we need this to convene court.

307
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,830
他说他要判个案！
He wants to try a case.

308
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,100
哪儿有冤呐？
What case?

309
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,670
谁敢有冤呐？
Has someone filed a complaint?

310
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,950
这都一百多年了
It's been here for 100 years.

311
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,510
你要把它砍了 把鼓露出来
If you now unveil the drum,

312
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,150
不定出多大冤呐？
who knows what case it may bring?

313
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,390
别砍啦！你爹他人呢？
Where's your old man?

314
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,550
睡觉！
In bed.

315
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,870
跟谁睡啊？怎么还睡啊？
At this hour? Who with?

316
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,300
鼓呢？
What happened?

317
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,150
鼓呢？
Where is it going?

318
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,870
叫你别砍吧 把鼓给砍跑了
Look what you've done!

319
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,670
鼓鼓鼓鼓！
Drum...!

320
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,980
躲开
Out of my way!

321
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,430
这鼓怎么跟着我呀
It's homing in on me!

322
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,230
救命呀…！大人
Help! Help!

323
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,710
可惜了老子的酒
My wine is ruined,

324
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,870
老子的雅兴全让你给毁了
my mood destroyed!

325
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,180
全毁了！
Everything's spoilt!

326
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,070
改日我再收拾你
I'll deal with you another day.

327
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,070
鼓都捶破了
The drum is shattered!

328
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,230
说明你们俩很冤呐
So there must be a case to try!

329
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,380
升堂！
Court!

330
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,950
冤从何来？
How have you been wronged?

331
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,980
没冤！
I'm not.

332
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:06,110
有冤的说冤 没冤的那就散！散会
If no one is wronged, case dismissed!

333
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,190
冤！
Sir!

334
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,710
不是我冤 是武举老爷冤！
I have wronged Master Wu.

335
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,860
小的不长眼
I was careless.

336
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,670
在躲鼓的时候碰洒了武举老爷的酒
I ran into him and knocked over his wine.

337
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,550
害的武举老爷没有了胃口
Completely ruining his day.

338
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,950
小的应该给武举老爷赔礼 赔礼
I need to kowtow and apologise. Sorry!

339
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,180
老子不冤
That was nothing.

340
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,950
敢说你不冤
How dare you say nothing?

341
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:23,870
跪下！
Kneel!

342
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,670
这可是黄四郎的团练教头
He coaches Huang's militia.

343
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,230
跪不得
Go easy on him.

344
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,990
老子是光绪三十一年
During the reign of the last Emperor,

345
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,630
皇上钦点的武举人
I was bestowed a Martial Scholar.

346
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,590
论官职 比你官大
My rank was higher than yours.

347
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,790
你应该给老子跪下
You should kneel in front of me!

348
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,150
跪下！
Kneel!

349
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,590
跪不跪？
Kneel!

350
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,950
还皇上！
This is bullshit!

351
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,630
哪个皇上？我见过吗？
The last Emperor? Have I ever met him?

352
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,990
你要是个文举人
If you'd been a Literary Scholar,

353
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,630
他应该给你磕两百个头
he'd have to kowtow 200 times.

354
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,430
可惜你只是个武举人
But as a Martial Scholar,

355
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,670
他只能给你磕一百个头
you'll get only 100 kowtows.

356
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,110
现在他两百个头磕完了
Since he has already done 200,

357
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,070
你还他一百个
you've to return 100 kowtows.

358
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,030
可我只磕了两个
But I've only kowtowed twice!

359
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,430
两个也得还你一百个
Does it really matter?

360
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,070
磕不磕？
Do it!

361
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,310
打！
Flog him!

362
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,950
这个不好使
That's no good.

363
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,780
得使这个！
This is more effective.

364
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,310
哎！别打！我磕！
Stop! I'll do it.

365
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,350
行了
Splendid!

366
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,790
你磕头！你数数！
You kowtow, and you do the counting.

367
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,910
一二三四五六…
One, two, three, four...

368
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,990
青天大老爷！
Hail, Governor!

369
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,300
起来！不准跪！
Stand up everyone!

370
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,670
皇上都没了 没人值得你们跪！
No one is worth kneeling to.

371
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,830
我也不值你们跪！
Least of all to me!

372
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,190
我来鹅城只办三件事
I've brought three things to Goose Town.

373
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,900
公平！
Justice,
justice,

374
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,150
还是公平！
and goddamned justice.

375
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,390
青天大老爷！
Hail, Governor!

376
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,830
站起来！不准跪！
Stand up! No kneeling!

377
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,790
这就对了
That's better.

378
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,420
不准跪？
No kneeling?

379
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,230
这哪是打我的屁股
He was not only flogging me,

380
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,550
这明明是打您的脸
he was slapping you in the face!

381
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,510
老爷 等我把屁股养好了
When my butts stop hurting,

382
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,710
我亲手给你报仇！
I will personally avenge you.

383
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,910
那就把卖凉粉的叫来
Summon the noodle vendor.

384
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,750
县长喜欢判案
If our governor loves to try,

385
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,350
就安排一点案子给他判叹
we'll give him a case to try.

386
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,030
爹 今天你这县长干得真漂亮
Pop, you were brilliant today.

387
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,870
打武举人打得真过瘾
Flogging that martial scholar was a hoot!

388
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,590
将来我也想当县长
I'd love to be a governor one day.

389
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,070
你不能当县长 也不许当土匪
I don't want you to be a bandit or politician.

390
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,870
你爹死的时候把你交给我
When your father entrusted you to me,

391
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,020
我答应过他 要让你有出息
I promised I'd raise you properly.

392
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,950
那我当什么才有出息？
Then what should I do?

393
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,350
当学生！读书 多听这个
Study and learn to enjoy this.

394
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,900
没声啊！
There is no sound!

395
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,110
这帮买官的县长 就知道捞钱
Politicians only know how to bully.

396
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,910
唱机都撂坏了
This gramophone was broken,

397
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,750
修好了
Now it is fixed.

398
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,220
这单活干完了 爹赚了钱
Once we're done here,

399
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,950
我送你去留洋
I'll let you study abroad.

400
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,820
东洋三年
3 years in the east,

401
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,550
西洋三年
3 in the west,

402
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,590
南洋三年
and 3 more in the south.

403
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,270
北洋 北洋三年
How about 3 years in the north?

404
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,830
傻孩子 你生在北洋 不必留了
No, you're born in the north.

405
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,390
这是谁吹的？
Who is this by?

406
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,590
听着像穆扎
I think it's Wolfgang.

407
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,310
他们那边叫穆扎
Sometime known as Amadeus.

408
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,270
咱们这边叫莫札特
We call him M-o-z-a-r-t.

409
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,000
你还能听出来是谁吹的呢？!
You can tell by listening?

410
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,430
得分时候
It depends.

411
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,110
什么时候？
On what?

412
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,750
那上面印着他名字的时候
If his name was printed there.

413
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,230
爹 这叫穆扎这人
Pop, this Mozart...

414
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,190
他是怎么把这东西吹到这里边的？
How did he get the sound in there?

415
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,420
你去留完洋 你就什么都知道了
You'll learn by studying abroad.

416
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,630
那这个穆扎在哪儿？
Where's this Mozart?

417
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,790
我留洋的时候要去哪找他？
How can I find him?

418
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,590
他呀 离咱们很远
He is far away from us.

419
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,830
怎么做 知道了吗？
Know what you have to do?

420
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,670
知道了
Yes.

421
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,430
谁让你去做的 你也知道了吗？
Who ordered you to do this?

422
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,740
知道了
Who, sir?

423
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,790
是老爷叫你去的吗？
Did I tell you to do it?

424
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,990
是 是老爷让我去的
Yes, sir. You did.

425
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:05,830
我
No, it's "me"!

426
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,630
你？
You?

427
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,630
你 你自己
You, you yourself!

428
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,710
我自己 我自己
Yes, me and me alone.

429
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,020
听不见
I can't hear you.

430
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,230
是我自己要去的
It's my own plot.

431
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,700
没有人让我去 是我自己
There are no co-conspirators.

432
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,830
恩人！恩人！
Saviour! My saviour!

433
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,110
恩人！
Saviour!

434
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,510
你是叫我呢？
You're addressing me?

435
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,510
我什么时候成你恩人了？
Since when have I become your saviour?

436
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,190
不杀之恩为大恩！
You spared my life,

437
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,190
为报不杀之恩 我也救你一命
and I'll save yours in return.

438
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,510
哦？你快说
Do tell.

439
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,590
寡妇 不能睡啊！
Never sleep with a widow.

440
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,990
必有大灾！
It's very bad luck!

441
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,150
她…
She?

442
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,710
真的是寡妇么？
Is she really a widow?

443
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,070
我看着不像
She doesn't act like one.

444
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,030
我亲眼看见他丈夫淹死的
But I witnessed her husband drowned!

445
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,230
她已经成了寡妇
If she really is a widow,

446
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,030
我不能…
Then I must not...

447
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,630
让她再守活寡
Ieave her alone uncomforted.

448
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,430
这是第一步
That's my first move.

449
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,710
三步之内…
Within three...

450
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,440
要不让他们滚蛋走人
they'll either leave with tails
between their legs,

451
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,110
要不让他们跪下当狗！
or stay and become our poodles!

452
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,230
对 非常对
Right, absolutely right.

453
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,110
老爷 您找我？
You're looking for me, sir?

454
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,790
官府的人还没来？
Have you entertained our new officials yet?

455
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,750
没有
Not yet.

456
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,060
县长不嫖妓？
The Governor doesn't frequent brothels?

457
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,390
不好色的县长 不一定是好县长
He'll never make a good governor.

458
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,910
我就是不好色！
I don't indulge much in sex.

459
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,790
所以您当不了县长
So you won't make a good governor either.

460
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,670
我当不了县长？
Why is that so?

461
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,670
县长哪能跟您比呀
The two bear no comparison!

462
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,390
他只是流水的县长
Governors come and go.

463
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,590
您才是铁打的老爷
But you, sir, will always be our godfather!

464
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,910
你真会讲话
You speak well!

465
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,750
他们一定会来 你要好好记住
I'm sure they will come.

466
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,630
他们讲的每一句有用的话
Eavesdrop their every conversation,

467
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,750
都要回来跟我汇报
report their every move.

468
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,630
是
Yes.

469
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,110
走吧 你不要变成小凤仙哦
Go now. Just don't become a Mata Hari!

470
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,750
老爷 谁是小凤仙？
Who's Mata Hari, Master?

471
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,950
小凤仙都不知道还当妓女
What kind of whore are you?

472
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,350
那可是名震京城 誉满全国的妓女
She's the world's most infamous double agent!

473
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,300
你们出去吧
You two can leave.

474
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:41,310
县长此刻正怀抱夫人 共枕同眠
Now the Governor is in bed with his wife.

475
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,790
让他睡最后一个安稳觉
Let him enjoy one more night in peace!

476
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,030
县长公子 以身试法
The Governor's boy is in trouble,

477
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,660
讲茶大堂 恭迎大驾！
your presence is requested at the teahouse.

478
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,140
讲茶大堂？县衙不是判案的地方吗？
Why don't they convene at the magistracy?

479
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,670
你这个县衙是摆设
The magistracy is just for show.

480
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,950
判案只有去讲茶大堂！那才是真县衙！
All cases are tried at the teahouse.

481
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,390
六爷
Master Six,

482
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,430
你吃了两碗的粉
you've eaten two bowls of jelly,

483
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,700
只给了一碗的钱
and paid only for one.

484
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,390
放屁 我就吃了一碗的粉
Bullshit! I have only eaten one bowl!

485
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,990
给了他一碗的钱！
And I paid him for one.

486
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,110
他吃了几碗？
How many bowls did he eat?

487
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,190
两碗
Two...

488
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,500
不可能！
No way!

489
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,190
六爷是县长的儿子
Master Six is the Governor's godson,

490
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,070
怎么能欠你的粉钱呢？
why would he want to cheat you?

491
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,150
就是吃了两碗 只给了一碗的钱
But he ate two bowls and paid for one.

492
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:20,830
县长要给我们鹅城一个公平
The Governor brings justice to our town.

493
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,110
好！
Good!

494
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,350
我今天讨的就是一个公平
And justice is what I seek today!

495
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,150
对
Hear hear!

496
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,750
问谁讨？问县长儿子。为什么？
From the Governor's son, of course.

497
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,110
他吃了两碗粉 只给了一碗的钱
Ate two bowls, paid for one!

498
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,230
这就叫作不公平！
That's so wrong!

499
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,550
既然县长儿子带头不公平
Since his boy is guilty of unjust,

500
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,310
那县长说的话就是个屁
the Governor's crusade is bullshit!

501
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,190
我操
Screw you!

502
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,980
六爷…
Master Six...

503
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,350
胡万 六爷是县长的儿子
Master Six is the Governor's godson!

504
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,950
怎么会欠他的粉钱呢？
Would he cheat over a bowl of jelly?

505
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,910
你亲眼看见了？
Did you see it with your own eyes?

506
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,390
嘿 你个吃里爬外的东西
You double-crosser!

507
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,750
怎么着？
What's wrong with you?

508
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,190
屁股不疼了？
You're thinking with your butts?

509
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,030
今不聊屁股的事
It's not about my butts.

510
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,630
就聊凉粉
We're here for the truth!

511
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,390
一碗就是一碗 两碗就是两碗
One or two bowls?

512
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,620
不能含糊
No beating about the bush!

513
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,390
六爷 汉子！佩服！
I admire your courage, sir.

514
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,790
一就是一 二就是二
I know how to count!

515
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,070
我今天就吃了一碗凉粉
I ate only one bowl!

516
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,750
你给了一碗的钱 吃了两碗粉
You ate two and paid for one.

517
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,750
你没钱是吧 我帮你给！
If you can't afford it, my treat!

518
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,070
看见了吗？多少碗我都付得起！
I can afford all the jelly in this world!

519
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,510
但是吃一碗的粉 就给一碗的钱
But I pay only for what I ate.

520
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,950
这么多钱 他吃了多少碗粉啊
How many bowls did he eat?

521
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,750
你早说不就得了吗
Let's be frank.

522
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,900
他要个公平
He wants to be treated fairly.

523
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,350
你不是欺负老实人吗？
It's wrong to bully a commoner.

524
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,180
告诉我 你是老实人吗？
Are you an honest person?

525
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:46,950
我是
Yes, I am...

526
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,270
那你就说实话 我到底吃了几碗粉？
How many bowls did I eat?

527
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,910
你告诉他！
Tell him!

528
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,550
你说不说？
Speak up!

529
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,950
拿枪吓唬一可怜的 卖凉粉的
Stop threatening this poor man with a gun!

530
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,150
有枪是吧？谁没有枪啊！
Who doesn't carry a gun around here?

531
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,550
孙守义
Noodle vendor!

532
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,630
大声说 他吃了几碗
How many bowls did he eat?

533
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,750
守义 在座所有的乡亲
Everyone in this teahouse,

534
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,270
都会为你和你的家人作主的
will bear witness on your behalf.

535
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,230
大声说 几碗
Speak up! How many?

536
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,260
两碗
Two bowls.

537
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,870
你是一个恶人！
You're nasty!

538
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,950
比恶是吧 我比你还恶
But I dare you to match me!

539
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,510
都看好了啊
Take a good look!

540
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,910
今我肚子里要有两碗粉
If there are two bowls of jelly in me,

541
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,030
我白死
I'll die!

542
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,310
你要是肚子里只有一碗粉
If there's only one,

543
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,230
我死！
I'll die.

544
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,670
要是有两碗粉 我陪六爷一起死
If he has two bowls in him, I'll die with him!

545
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,550
凉粉呢？
Where's the jelly?

546
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,310
太浅了 我看不见
Deeper! I can't see.

547
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,870
六爷！佩服！
Very gutsy, sir!

548
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,150
凉粉在肠子里 你得横着拉一下
Try sliding the blade sideway,

549
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,300
才能让我看得见
so that we can all see.

550
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,190
六爷 让大家看看是一碗还是两碗
Show us if there is one or two bowls.

551
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,750
拉！
Out with it!

552
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,710
六爷 碗！
Here's a bowl, sir.

553
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,590
看见了吧！看见了吧！
See! Can you see?

554
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,870
是不是只有一碗！
One bowl!
There's only one bowl, right?

555
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,270
六爷 挺住！我去给你请大夫！
Hang in there! I'll get a doctor!

556
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,590
别走！是不是只有一碗！
There's only one bowl, right?

557
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,910
是不是只有一碗！是不是！
There's only one bowl, right?

558
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,140
该你了
Your turn!

559
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,510
我知道你只吃了一碗
I knew it all along.

560
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,150
你上当了
You fell for it.

561
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,670
不能杀…！我不能放！
You mustn't kill him! No, I won't!

562
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:12,950
为什么不能杀？
Tell me why I should spare him,

563
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,750
说不出说法来 我把你一起杀了
or I'll shoot you, too.

564
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,830
杀了他 六子白死
Don't let Six die in vain!

565
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,630
我没有杀他 他自己捅自己的！
I didn't do it. He stabbed himself.

566
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,750
我们在打赌
We'd a wager.

567
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:21,900
他输了
He lost.

568
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,630
大哥 你让我一枪崩了他！
Let me blast his head off!

569
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,750
你不敢杀我！你不能杀我！
You wouldn't dare! You can't do it.

570
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,870
黄四郎就想看你这样！
Huang is provoking you.

571
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,230
一脸的败相！
He wants you to lose your head.

572
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,190
杀了他就是输 不杀还能赢
We'll lose if we kill him now.

573
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,070
放人
Let him go.

574
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,750
杀人诛心 杀人诛心！
You must destroy Huang's soul!

575
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,550
师爷说得对放人
- Pop, he's right. - Let him go!

576
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,110
刀进了肚子 那凉粉还是凉粉？
He stabbed himself? What about the jelly?

577
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,310
是
Yes

578
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,510
不是
and no...

579
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,710
我就想知道 凉粉到底还是不是凉粉
Tell me if it was still jelly.

580
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,550
是凉粉！
Yes, it was.

581
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,070
过来过来
Come over here.

582
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,660
那么…
And...

583
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,940
人死了？
is he dead?

584
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,510
死了
Yes.

585
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,820
所以…你就把我供出来了？
Did you implicate me?

586
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,790
我是用老爷的名字吓唬他们
I did invoke your name.

587
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,180
他们被吓着了么？
Were they scared?

588
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,790
他们说杀人诛心！
They said to kill, a person's soul
must first be destroyed.

589
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,270
杀人还要诛心？
Murder? Soul destruction?

590
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,150
好可怕啊！
How awful.

591
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,790
六弟 四哥发誓替你报仇！
Brother, I vow to avenge you!

592
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,350
六弟 五哥发誓替你报仇！
Brother, I swear I'll avenge you!

593
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,300
六哥 七弟发誓替你报仇！
Brother, I vow to avenge you!

594
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,980
二哥喝醉了 他让我带话
Two is drunk. I am pledging for him.

595
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,910
二哥发誓替你报仇！
He will avenge your death, too.

596
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,310
六弟 三哥发誓替你报仇！
Brother, I swear to avenge you!

597
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,790
二哥没喝醉 他生气了！
Two is sober, he's just pissed off!

598
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,750
大哥不想让大伙拼命
Chief doesn't want to risk our lives.

599
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,910
命都不拼 还算麻匪吗？
Are we boy scouts or what?

600
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,190
大哥不应该听他的
Chief should have ignored Tang.

601
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,350
姓汤的不是个好玩意
He is a good-for-nothing!

602
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:17,630
六爷 黄四郎这招叫杀人不用刀
Huang kills without lifting a finger!

603
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,710
我给你爹出的招叫杀人诛心
We must retaliate by destroying his soul.

604
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,350
不能拼命啊！拼命还怎么赚钱！
We can't jeopardise our chance to get rich!

605
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,980
六子
Six...

606
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,870
挣钱对我算个事儿吗？
I do not care about being rich.

607
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,870
我不是要杀人诛心 是没想出好办法
But I must come up with a game plan

608
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,990
我要把黄四郎连根都拔掉
to rid of Huang once and for all

609
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,230
给我点时间
Give me time,

610
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,670
六子 爹发誓一定给你报仇！
Pop will avenge your death.

611
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,790
把脸收拾收拾
Show your respect!

612
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,070
六爷 一路走好
Have a safe journey, Six.

613
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,550
六爷 一路走好！
Safe travel, Six!

614
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,910
先打哪一张牌？
How should I play my hand?

615
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,070
请客、斩首、收下当狗！
Banquet, kill him or throw him to the dogs?

616
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,910
斩！
I'd say kill him!

617
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,910
NO！
No!

618
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,140
NO？
No?

619
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,110
请客！
Host a banquet!

620
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,510
鸿门宴！凶多吉少
Dinner invitation! It's a death trap!

621
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,950
杀人诛心 赫然奏效！
Our ploy is working!

622
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,390
我再送你一个字
I have another idea: delay tactics.

623
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,790
抻！抻拉得越久 赚得越多
The longer we drag this on the better!

624
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,030
到时候跪在这儿的就是黄四郎本人
Huang will end up kneeling here.

625
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,550
什么鸿门宴！
What kind of banquet is this?

626
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,310
就是恶霸请土匪！
It's just a meeting between two thugs!

627
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,110
项羽请刘邦啊！
It's like MacBeth hosting Banquo.

628
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,550
刘邦后来干什么去了？
What'd become of Banquo the guest?

629
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,310
当皇帝了
His son became king.

630
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,660
项羽呢？
And MacBeth the host?

631
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,230
那 赴宴？
So we should go.

632
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,270
赴宴！正好借机把黄四郎也笼络过来
We can also sound out Huang,

633
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,510
咱们三个联手一起捞钱
and see if we can work together.

634
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,430
「把家伙拿来」
"Bring the guns."

635
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,950
「换上黄家衣服跟我走」
"Dress up as Huang's militia and follow me."

636
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,950
明白
Got it!

637
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,550
「干掉黄四郎 给六子报仇」
"Kill Huang and avenge Six!"

638
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,070
明白
Understood!

639
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:06,070
老汤 你是把六子的死当捞钱的成本了？
You see Six's death as a shortcut to bonanza?

640
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,430
我看你当成本 赚的钱会更多
Perhaps your severed head can make us more.

641
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,790
这是什么意思？
What do you mean?

642
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,990
走！去会会你的新朋友
Let's go and meet your new pal.

643
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,550
立正！
Attention!

644
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,660
县长 师爷 大驾光临！有失远迎！
Governor, counselor! Welcome!

645
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,950
黄老爷的宅邸 竹林掩映 碉楼耸立
Master's citadel dominates Goose Town.

646
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,710
易守难攻 万夫莫开！
It is simply impregnable.

647
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,150
县长英雄气概 师爷文采斐然
An intrepid governor, an erudite counselor.

648
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,590
珠联璧合！二位请！
What a dream team!

649
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,710
六爷的死 壮烈！
Master Six has died heroically.

650
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,070
今天请县长来
I've invited you here today

651
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,590
就是要当面为六爷讨回这个公道！
to witness how justice is done.

652
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,630
如果真的是黄某指使
If I'm proven to be the instigator,

653
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,020
那我就像六爷一样
I will follow Master Six's footstep,

654
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,030
当众剖腹自杀！
and disembowel myself!

655
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,950
不但自杀 还请县长您
I invite you to be my second,

656
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,270
当我的介错人
to ritualistically cut my head off

657
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:23,590
砍下我人头 高挂艳阳楼顶！
and hang it from the restaurant.

658
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,310
万一不是我
If I'm proven innocent,

659
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,670
那就是辱我名声
those who slandered me

660
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,710
欺骗县长
and shamed you in the process...

661
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,430
你们自裁
will have to kill themselves.

662
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,990
要么三命抵一命 要么随时告发我
It's me against these three.

663
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,990
我随时死
I am ready.

664
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,750
黄老爷 我听说自裁用短刀
You should use this for disembowelment.

665
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,590
长刀归介错人
The full blade is for your second.

666
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,790
是吗？
Really?

667
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,590
果然在行！县长随时可以当我的介错人
It's great to have an expert as my second!

668
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,510
马县长 请！
This way, please.

669
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,060
马某人这个县长 买来的
I bought this governorship.

670
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,750
买官就是为了挣钱
Sole purpose is to get rich.

671
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,390
而且 马某人不喜欢挣穷人的钱
But I don't take from the poor.

672
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,270
那你想挣谁的钱呢？
Then who are you targeting?

673
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,350
谁有钱就挣谁的！
Only the wealthy people.

674
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,310
那谁有钱？
Who are the wealthy?

675
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,790
你有钱
Such as you.

676
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,430
爽快！县长看上什么了 随便拿
Whatever you fancy, help yourself.

677
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,030
我不是土匪！我是县长
I'm no bandit. I'm a governor.

678
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,950
县长挣钱得讲究个名正言顺才是
I make my fortune the proper way.

679
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:38,870
说得好
Well said!

680
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,990
我们鹅城有两大家族
Goose Town has two big families.

681
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,070
都是把人卖到America修铁路
They sell people to America to build railroads,

682
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,800
挣的都是dollar
in return for dollars!

683
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,350
还说刀的事
What do you mean by dolls?

684
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:52,180
NO… dollar  美国人用的钱
No, d-o-l-l-a-r-s! American money.

685
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,420
dollar！You know？
Dollar! You know?

686
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,990
dollar 到了
Oh, dollars!

687
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,910
黄老爷一来 钱就到了
I can smell it in your presence!

688
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,300
-喝一杯吧       -好 来
- Let's drink to that! - Great, cheers!

689
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,870
来…
Cheers!

690
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,990
黄老爷 客气了
Master Huang is so modest.

691
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,230
整个南国谁不知道
It is an open secret that,

692
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,660
在鹅城
in Goose Town,

693
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,710
你黄四郎是老大！
Master Huang is our real boss!

694
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,750
老大往往是空架子
It is hard to be a boss.

695
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:21,510
每天眼一睁 几百人吃、喝、拉、撒
Hundreds of people everyday

696
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,150
都要等着我伺候
waiting to be fed.

697
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,670
真正落到我嘴里的 能有几口
There is little left for me.

698
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,510
如果县长真的急着赚钱
If you're looking to make a fast buck,

699
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,830
我倒是有个好去处！
I know exactly what to do.

700
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,070
哦？请讲！
Please tell.

701
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,520
张麻子
Pocky Zhang!

702
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,550
真死了！
One of them just died!

703
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,550
张麻子？
Pocky Zhang?

704
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,870
对 张麻子！
Yes, Pocky Zhang!

705
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,910
那么这个张麻子 是跟我们有关系呢？
What has he got to do with us?

706
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,990
还是跟钱有关系？
Or with our money?

707
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,140
都有关系！
Everything!

708
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,350
莫非他在鹅城？
Is he here in Goose Town?

709
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,700
在…
Well, yes...

710
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,030
也不在！
and no!

711
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,310
黄老爷这话 还挺有玄机啊！
Master Huang speaks in riddles!

712
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,750
这小子到底在哪呢？
Where is he, then?

713
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,510
听黄爷给咱们聊聊
Let Master Huang enlightens us.

714
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,670
此人盘踞鹅城周边交通咽喉
He has grabbed Goose Town by its balls!

715
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,900
-明白吗？     -不明白
- Know what I mean? - No

716
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,750
我是做什么生意的？明白吗？
Know what I do for a living?

717
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,590
不明白
No.

718
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,670
小半个民国的烟土
Half the opium smokers in this nation

719
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,630
都是黄老爷您在贩卖
rely on Master Huang for their supply!

720
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,750
错！我不过是给刘都统当跑腿的
No, I'm only a pawn for General Liu.

721
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,150
而且只是其中一条腿
I'm just one of his runners!

722
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,430
那么刘都统到底有几条腿呢？
How many runners does Liu have?

723
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,110
三条呗
Three.

724
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,350
黄老爷还是条大腿
And Master is the most able one!

725
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,270
对！大腿！
Yes, the strongest one!

726
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,870
可是我这条腿…
But this runner,

727
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,150
断了！
is now crippled!

728
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,110
断了？
Crippled?

729
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:03,830
怎么断的？
What happened?

730
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,230
我的货十回有八回被张麻子劫走了！
Zhang has seized nearly all my goods.

731
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,830
你想想 他赚了多少钱？
Imagine what he can make from them.

732
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,070
那这个张麻子很富有啊！
He must be very well off!

733
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,630
还有这种事儿？
I wonder if this is true.

734
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,710
如果你们可以去剿匪的话
You can write your own cheque,

735
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,390
钱要多少有多少
if you can take him out!

736
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,430
我们没胆子剿匪
We wouldn't dare to!

737
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,190
但是 借剿匪之名敛财的胆子
But if this can make us rich,

738
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,430
还是有 而且很大！
I wouldn't mind having a go!

739
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,790
那就不要怪我！就怪你们没出息
Then blame yourself for your timidity!

740
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,750
不过 我还可以帮你们一个忙
But I would be happy to assist.

741
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,990
我出钱 当诱饵
I can put up money as a bait.

742
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,940
我出多少 两大家族必须出多少！
The families have to match my contribution.

743
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,680
就等您这句话呢！足够！
We're hoping you'd say that.

744
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,190
那您出八十万？
How about $800,000?

745
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,150
NO！我出一百八十万
No! I'll put up $1.8 million!

746
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,190
出得多 挣得多！
The more the merrier!

747
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:55,030
明白！事成之后 一百八十万如数奉还
Yes, we'll pay you back $1.8 million,

748
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,070
咱们分两大家族那点儿dollar！
and split the dollars from the others.

749
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,830
一百八十万不用还！
There's no need to pay him back!

750
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,790
不就是剿匪么！剿！
We'll hit these bandits hard!

751
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,190
咱们把张麻子劫走的那点钱
Whatever they seized in the past,

752
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,550
全拿回来 还给黄老爷！
we will retrieve for the Master.

753
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:10,230
到那个时候
Look at the bigger picture,

754
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,710
这一百八十万就是九牛身上的一根毛
the $1.8 million bounty is but a strand of hair.

755
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,710
您还在意吗？
Surely you won't mind!

756
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,910
不就是个小小的张麻子吗？办他！
We'll get rid of Pocky Zhang!

757
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:18,830
硬！
Cool!

758
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,980
-硬吗？     -够硬！
- Cool enough? - Very cool!

759
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,510
硬不硬以后再说！
We can discuss that later.

760
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,350
我脑子里想的只有一件事
The only thing I want to do now

761
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,350
替黄老爷把这条腿接上！
is to fix Master's crippled leg.

762
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,030
一个张麻子也太嚣张了！
Pocky Zhang's such a nuisance.

763
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,870
欺负到黄哥头上了 不答应
He shouldn't have messed with Master Huang!

764
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:32,750
喝酒
Let's top up.

765
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,670
我以为 酒一口一口喝
I believe in taking our time,

766
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,270
路一步一步走
doing things step by step!

767
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,070
步子迈大了 喀！
I don't want to break my balls

768
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,270
容易扯着蛋
by over-stretching!

769
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,510
应该先把dollar分清楚
We should agree on the split first,

770
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,870
再说接腿的事儿
before thinking of how to fix his leg.

771
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,990
你还聊dollar是吧？不聊接腿？
If you want to settle the split now,

772
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,380
那你们俩聊吧
then just carry on.

773
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,430
师爷 你定
Counselor, you decide.

774
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,660
先聊dollar吧
About the dollars,

775
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,110
dollar到手 按照惯例 三七分
Iet's do a customary 30-70 split.

776
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,710
你也太不仗义了吧！
How can you even say that?

777
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,440
黄老爷为这事忙前忙后
Master Huang is so instrumental.

778
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,020
你就分人家三成？
And you give him only 30%?

779
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,030
怎么也得对半分啊！
Let's go 50-50!

780
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,870
那我…那我错了
My apologies, Master Huang.

781
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,990
你太错了
So inconsiderate!

782
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,190
师爷
Counselor,

783
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,790
我们还是听县长的 对半分
I'll go along with that: 50-50.

784
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,950
如果真有胆子剿匪
If you've the guts to take on the bandits,

785
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,030
两大家族的dollar
the dollars from the two families,

786
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,150
就值一根毛
are but strands of hair!

787
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,910
一根毛！
Strands of hair!

788
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,790
哪是一根啊！
May not be even that!

789
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,910
胆子你是有的
I know you have the courage.

790
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,260
本事呢？
But ability-wise...?

791
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,510
我凭什么相信你能剿张麻子？
How do I know if you can overcome Zhang?

792
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,390
黄老爷 容兄弟问你个问题
May I ask you a question, sir?

793
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,150
请
Go ahead.

794
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,880
张麻子能劫你的货
If Zhang can seize your goods,

795
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,990
为什么不能进你的家呢？
why can't he break in here?

796
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,700
我这碉楼 固若金汤
My citadel is impregnable.

797
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,510
易守难攻 他进不来！
There's no way that he can get in.

798
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,710
那你怎么就真的相信
Are you sure

799
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,950
只有我跟师爷进了你的碉楼呢？
that we're the only ones here?

800
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,270
说让咱们撤？
An order to retreat!

801
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,950
-撤？      -那撤么？
- Split? - You sure?

802
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,140
撤
Let's split.

803
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:12,950
「遵命 但我很担心你」
"Chief, watch your back."

804
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,150
听见了吧？
Did you hear that?

805
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,110
听见了
Yes.

806
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,670
张麻子进不来的地方 我能进来
Where Pocky fails to breach, I succeeded!

807
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:22,070
张麻子不想死的时候 我能让他死
I can kill him when he is least expecting it.

808
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,070
又死一个！
Another one bites the dust!

809
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,310
你们可以把我供出来嘛！
Implicate me for all you like.

810
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,270
不要委屈自己哦！
I couldn't care less!

811
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,390
马县长 我早看出 你非等闲之辈
Governor. I sense that you're special.

812
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,150
不敢当
I am flattered.

813
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,880
不过 有胆子剿匪的人
But those who waged war on the bandits,

814
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,670
九死一生
none has survived.

815
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,140
哦 何以见得？
Why not?

816
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,990
张麻子非同凡人
Pocky Zhang is a tough cookie.

817
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:52,150
二十年前 我们有过一面之缘
I met him once 20 years ago.

818
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,510
竟有如此的缘分
Isn't that fate?

819
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,350
那么 缘从何起呢？
How did it happen?

820
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,830
灯火阑珊 他蓦然回首
He stood by a lantern and turned towards me,

821
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,780
而我 却隐藏在灯影里
and I was standing in the shade.

822
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,390
一个在明处
He was well lit up,

823
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,590
一个在暗处
and you're in the dark!

824
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,030
嘘！quite quite！
Quiet, quiet...

825
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,390
那么彼时彼刻
So it was there and then...

826
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,390
恰如此时此刻
A bit like, here and now!

827
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,670
竟能如此相像
What a coincidence!

828
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,400
像！很像！
Exactly!

829
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,190
不过你比他缺了一样东西
But you're missing something.

830
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,430
不会是脸上的麻子吧
You mean his facial scars?

831
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,750
当然不是
Of course not.

832
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,300
那么是什么呢？
Then what is it?

833
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,150
你不会装糊涂
You don't know how to play act.

834
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,990
准！大哥
Exactly!

835
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,510
我还在娘胎里的时候
A fortune teller told my mother

836
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,750
算命先生就指着我娘的肚子说
before I was even born!

837
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,630
这孩子将来最大的缺点
He said my Achilles heel

838
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,550
就是不会装糊涂！
would be my inability to play act!

839
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,350
大哥 我还能改吗？
Can I change it?

840
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,310
改不了！天生的
No way! It's in your genes!

841
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:56,390
你看看这位师爷就是装糊涂的高手
But our counselor is a born actor!

842
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,790
dollar说成刀
Confusing dollar with dolls?

843
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,100
dollar 是什么？
What is dollar?

844
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,580
美元！US dollar.
American money!

845
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,590
你看你看！装糊涂的天才啊！
A genius when it comes to play acting.

846
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,350
师爷 敬你的
Counselor, cheers!

847
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,150
谢黄老爷颂扬
Thanks for your compliment, sir.

848
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,350
容老弟真的糊涂一回
Allow me to play the fool for once.

849
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,710
剿匪成功之后 追回的烟土
After defeating the bandits,

850
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,830
我们只要两成就够！
we'll take just 20% of any opium recovered.

851
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,950
不行！对半开！
No, I insist 50-50!

852
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,750
为表诚意 预祝剿匪凯旋！
To show my sincerity,

853
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,950
一百八十万 马上送来！
I'll send over $1.8 million now.

854
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,910
无功不受禄 现在收钱太早
That's too soon. We haven't started yet!

855
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,430
黛玉 晴雯！
Marie, Claire!

856
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,430
大哥 美女我也不能要
Master, I can't take women.

857
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,510
美女不要 钱你也不要
No interest in money or women,

858
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,740
你要什么啊？
what do you want?

859
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,110
腿！
A runner.

860
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,540
什么腿啊？
What runner?

861
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,670
江湖豪情 侠胆柔肠之大腿
Master Huang's a runner of exceptional courage!

862
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:48,950
-哥！     -弟！
- Brother! - Brother!

863
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,750
你的腿 就是我的腿
We can run side by side!

864
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,630
你的腿 就是我的命
We'll run for our lives!

865
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,630
有道是 江湖本无路
Roads won't exist in this world of chaos,

866
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,630
有了腿 便有了路！
unless people like us run on them!

867
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,230
明白 明白
I see, I see...

868
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:03,750
我也明白
Yes, me too.

869
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,110
该死的东西！
Stupid bitch!

870
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,190
花有重开日
While flowers can blossom again,

871
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,430
人无再少年
time lost will never return.

872
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,990
姑娘如花似玉
This girl is as delicate as jade.

873
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,540
大哥 怒不得啊！
Please don't be mad at her.

874
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,550
黄老爷 easy easy！
Master Huang, easy easy...

875
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,910
相见恨晚！
Shame we didn't meet until now!

876
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,150
姑娘、钻石一并送上！
Diamonds, the girl - they're all yours.

877
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:43,310
唉！我带夫人来的
I've brought my wife with me.

878
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,990
再收姑娘不方便
So I can't take her home.

879
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,510
那钻石送夫人
Then take the diamonds for your wife.

880
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,350
好！我先替她收着
I accept them on her behalf.

881
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:50,670
起来吧
Get up.

882
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,870
不是黛玉和晴雯吗？
I thought you'd summoned two girls.

883
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,070
怎么就来了一名女子？
How come there's only her?

884
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,870
莫非她就叫黛玉晴雯？
You mean she is Marie-Claire?

885
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,350
说你不会装糊涂吧
You are really naive!

886
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,190
起了个东洋名字
She's adopted a fashionable name.

887
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,430
黛玉晴雯子！
It's Marie-Claire!

888
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,150
全死了！
There goes the last of them!

889
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,870
师爷 高！
A wise counselor!

890
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,230
县长 硬！
A tough governor!

891
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,080
黄老爷又高又硬！
Master, you're both wise and tough.

892
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,990
你到底是不是张麻子？
Are you really "Pocky" Zhang?

893
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,790
要说你是吧
Supposing that you are.

894
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,390
掰断刘都统大腿
You've already made a fortune

895
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,820
挣那么多钱
from "crippling" Liu's runners.

896
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:30,310
何苦进城当县长呢？
Why bother with Goose Town?

897
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,700
要说你不是吧…
But if you are someone else...

898
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,550
恩人？
Saviour?

899
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,910
今晚 杀鸡取卵！
Kill the chicken and take the eggs.

900
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,350
一定要在县长的床上
Let him die in his own bed.

901
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,950
不要让人以为吃了我的饭
Don't kill him on his way home

902
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,030
死在我家里 死在半路上
after dining as my guest.

903
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,110
明白！
Understood!

904
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,070
哪个是鸡？
Who is the "chicken"?

905
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:09,870
县长！
The Governor.

906
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:10,790
那么卵呢？
And the "eggs"?

907
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,950
是不是把县长给阉了？
I'll cut his balls off!

908
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,270
钻石！...
Diamonds!

909
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,740
我的两颗钻石！
My two diamonds!

910
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,060
老爷放心！你要的钻石
Don't worry, sir!

911
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,540
我这就给你弄回来
I'll retrieve your diamonds.

912
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,350
{\fnCronos Pro Light Subhead}I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

913
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,590
My pleasure Sir.
My pleasure, sir.

914
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,430
明白不明白 为什么派你去？
Know why I'm sending you?

915
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,350
因为我死了
It's because I'm already dead.

916
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:31,390
为什么你会死呢？
Do you know why?

917
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,820
因为我把老爷给供出来了
I shouldn't have implicated you.

918
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,390
对喽！如果你活着 早晚都会死
Right! If you are alive, you'll eventually die.

919
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,350
如果你死了
But if you're dead,

920
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,590
你永远都活着
you may live on forever!

921
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,710
明白
Understood.

922
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,110
杀鸡取卵！
Kill the chicken, take the eggs!

923
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,940
师爷 大哥呢？
Where's Chief?

924
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,180
马上呢 喝醉了
Punch drunk!

925
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,670
人呢？哪儿呢？
Where is he?

926
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,790
刚才还说话呢！
We're still chatting just now!

927
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,220
我也喝醉了
I must be drunk, too!

928
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:54,950
回来跟你算帐
I'll sort you out later.

929
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,660
没在马上么？是不是掉路上了？
He must've fallen off the horse.

930
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,230
听说你睡觉了
I heard that you slept.

931
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,870
你抬起头来跟我说话
Look up when you speak.

932
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:13,510
听说你昨天睡觉了
I heard that you slept last night.

933
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,150
我哪天不睡觉啊！
I sleep every goddamned night!

934
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:17,660
你看着我说话
Look at me when you speak.

935
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,430
听说你跟土匪睡觉了
You slept with the bandit?

936
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,710
睡了！你不想知道我们怎么睡的吗？
Do you want a blow-by-blow account?

937
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:25,230
对 怎么睡的？
Tell me more.

938
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,270
一个青楼女子 跟一个土匪头子
When a seasoned pro meets a bandit chief,

939
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,230
什么睡法都能有
anything could happen!

940
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:36,030
嘘什么嘘？
What now?

941
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,590
你这个不要脸的骚窑姐 婊子 贱货
Whore! Bitch! Vixen! Tramp!

942
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,710
你说什么！
What did you call me?

943
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,910
贱货 骚货 婊子 贱货！
Whore! Bitch! Vixen! Tramp!

944
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,630
时间不够
If I'd more time,

945
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,430
要不然我活活把你办踏实了！
I'll put you in your place!

946
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,780
好啊 来呀
Come on!

947
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:53,430
看你怎么办
I dare you!

948
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,750
你就只剩下一张嘴！
You're all talk!

949
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:00,150
写几个烂戏本的老色鬼！
A perverted, dirty old man.

950
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:01,380
不是我出钱
Could you have bought the post

951
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,030
谁给你买官当县长啊？
without my money?

952
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,790
你别逼急我了
Don't piss me off!

953
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,030
我还真觉得那个土匪挺有本事的
I think the bandit is more able!

954
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:08,750
他算什么本事啊？
What do you mean?

955
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,870
比你有本事
He's got more balls than you!

956
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,870
早烂醉如泥了
He's good at getting drunk!

957
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:20,030
这才是真本事
These will make your day!

958
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:24,020
六子 黄四郎今天死了三条狗
Three of Huang's dogs died today.

959
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,190
我知道 狗命抵不了你的命
I know they're not worthy of you.

960
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:29,620
我本来带着弟兄们
I was going to lead our brothers,

961
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,950
要跟黄四郎拼个鱼死网破
engage Huang in a deadly duel,

962
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,230
给你报仇
and avenge your death.

963
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,790
可是中途我改了主意
But I've changed my mind.

964
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,950
鱼死网破报不了仇
I can't take revenge this way.

965
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,390
弟兄们不能再死人了
I can't risk more lives.

966
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,310
大哥 你怎么在这儿啊？
Chief, we're looking for you.

967
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,790
你怎么让我们撤了呀？
Why did you signal retreat?

968
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,790
黄四郎听见你们吹的哨声
Huang heard your whistling.

969
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,750
我就绝对安全了
I knew that I was safe.

970
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:55,110
去吧 我跟六子单独待会儿
Leave, I want to spend time alone with Six.

971
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,710
今天我算明白了
It has finally dawned on me,

972
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:03,030
为什么当初我会上山当麻匪
why I became a bandit in the first place.

973
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,060
就是因为跟这帮东西玩不起
I was no match for these people.

974
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,510
现在为了你 我必须玩得起
But I must take them on at their own game now,

975
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,830
还得玩得赢
and to win for you.

976
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,510
谁？
What the heck?

977
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,390
偷我的钻石！
You stole my diamonds.

978
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,710
这石头是给你的吗？
They're not meant for you.

979
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,950
是给县长夫人的
They're a gift for Mrs. Governor!

980
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:33,630
咱们俩谁是县长？
Which of us is the Governor?

981
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,940
谁是县长？
Who's the Governor?

982
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,430
我问你呢 谁是县长？
Tell me who's the Governor!

983
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,310
你是要杀我？
You want to kill me?

984
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:45,950
还是要睡我？
Or to sleep with me?

985
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:48,710
有什么不一样吗？
Is there a difference?

986
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:49,990
不一样啊！
It's different!

987
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,310
那就先睡 再杀
I can bed you first, and kill you later.

988
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,430
那还是杀了我吧
Then you'd better kill me now.

989
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,750
杀了你 我还怎么睡啊
I don't sleep with dead bodies!

990
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,150
我不能酒后欺负一个寡妇
I won't take drunken advantage of a widow,

991
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:09,870
是跟你睡
so I'll just sleep next to you,

992
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,830
不是睡你
not with you!

993
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,030
我居然上了你们的当！
Holy smoke! I was fooled!

994
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,070
你和武举人都是假死 是吧？
You and Wu both faked death!

995
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:04,990
不错
That's right.

996
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:05,950
为什么冒充麻匪？
Why dressed up as a bandit?

997
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,420
老子就是麻匪 张麻子是我大哥
I'm a bandit. "Pocky" Zhang's my boss!

998
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,190
那你是老几呀？
What's your rank, then?

999
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,030
老三
I am Three!

1000
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,750
老三 你出名了
Three, you've hit big time!

1001
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,710
有人冒充你了！
You've got yourself a fake!

1002
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,670
别听他废话了 大哥
Chief, don't listen to his bullshit!

1003
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,030
六子就死在他手上
He plotted Six's death.

1004
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,110
你让我一枪崩了他
Let me shoot him now!

1005
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:18,910
大哥？
Chief?

1006
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,710
是你大哥张麻子派你来的
Were you sent by "Pocky" Zhang?

1007
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,390
还是你老爷黄四郎派你来的？
Or by Master Huang?

1008
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,740
不能说错啊！
I want the right answer!

1009
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,670
-黄老爷     -为什么？
- Master Huang. - Why?

1010
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:28,950
他让我们假扮麻匪在城里抢劫
We commit crimes posing as bandits,

1011
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,910
他逼县长下令剿匪
forcing governors to launch expeditions.

1012
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:32,590
骗豪绅 刮百姓
Creating more chances for Huang to swindle.

1013
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,350
然后呢？
And then?

1014
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:34,230
-没了     -没了？
- That's all. - Really?

1015
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,380
其他事我真不知道！
I don't know anything else!

1016
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:37,030
为什么朝我床上开枪？
Why did you target my bed?

1017
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,760
黄老爷说你霸气外露
Master said you're arrogant,

1018
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:40,940
危险！
a threat!

1019
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,550
回去给他带个话 告诉他
Take him a message:

1020
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,750
他喜欢让人假死这一套
While he likes people to fake death,

1021
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:49,350
正好 我也喜欢让人多死几回这一套
I'm fond of killing people more than once!

1022
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,750
您要放我回去？
Letting me off again?

1023
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,390
只有你的话他听得懂
He can only understand words you say.

1024
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,870
大哥 可您到底是？
Chief, you're...

1025
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,670
不错 张麻子！
Yes, "Pocky" Zhang.

1026
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,190
可大哥您脸上没麻子
Where are your pockmarks?

1027
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,910
黄四郎脸上有四吗？
Does your boss have "Huang"
inscribed on his face?

1028
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:01,310
懂了
That's true.

1029
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:02,790
兄弟
My friend,

1030
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,070
我是张麻子这件事
you must not tell anyone,

1031
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,910
要替我永远保密
that I am "Pocky" Zhang.

1032
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,750
永远保密！
You have my word!

1033
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,030
我说我当不了县长
I never want to be a governor,

1034
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:15,830
你非花钱让我买这个官
but you still bought me this post!

1035
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,180
现在官被人家抢走了
The position has been usurped,

1036
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:25,790
你也就这么死了！
and now you're dead too.

1037
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,990
黄四郎带人来了
Huang has brought his militia.

1038
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,590
说是要帮我们打麻匪
Wanting to fight bandits with us.

1039
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,110
她是我老婆！
She was my wife.

1040
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,150
-我是县长！     -让他进来
- I am the governor! - Let him in.

1041
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,880
我就是马邦德！
I am Ma Bangde!

1042
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,380
县长如何了？县长如何了？
Is the Governor okay?

1043
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,830
你们追！一个麻匪也不能跑！
Give chase! Don't let anyone get away.

1044
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,670
天杀的麻匪
Those goddamned bandits!

1045
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,710
伤天害理
Scum of the earth!

1046
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,030
县长刚刚上任 竟和他的夫人双双…
The Governor has only just arrived...

1047
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,710
我说我当不了这个县长！
Said I didn't want to be a governor,

1048
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,990
你非得给我花钱买这个官！
but you still bought me this post!

1049
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,430
现在官倒是到手了
The governership is now mine,

1050
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,670
你倒这么走了！
but you've left me on my own.

1051
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,990
她是我老婆！
She was my wife.

1052
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,070
我就是县长
I am the governor!

1053
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,430
我就是马邦德！
I am Ma Bangde!

1054
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,190
你呀 太年轻了
You're too hot-headed.

1055
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,350
不该一进城就枪毙麻匪
You shouldn't have shot those bandits.

1056
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,830
他们一定会报复你的
They'll take revenge for sure.

1057
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,710
不哭 不哭
Don't cry.

1058
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,070
她是为鹅城死的
She died for Goose Town.

1059
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,910
得厚葬她呀
She deserves a proper burial!

1060
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:50,070
得让所有的乡绅都过来
Invite every townsfolk to attend.

1061
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,590
都来都来 我会安排
Certainly. I'll take care of it.

1062
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,260
因为天父依照他的恩赐和美意
"Here lies Madam Governor"

1063
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,080
容我们这位姐妹 容我们这位兄弟
"Master Six rests here in peace"

1064
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,150
…放下今生的担子
...to be relieved of life's burden.

1065
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,390
我们就亲切的将他放入土中
Thus we commit their bodies to earth.

1066
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,390
他们本是尘土
From which they came,

1067
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,750
现在 他们依然是尘土
and do now return.

1068
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,950
我们知道 这一切的生命气息
We know we can place ourselves,

1069
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,550
都在永生的慈爱的天父手里
in the hands of our Father in Heaven,

1070
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,670
而且他应允将永生…
who has promised us eternal life.

1071
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,270
我们是张麻子张大爷的队伍！
We're from "Pocky" Zhang's gang.

1072
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,270
要钱！不要命！
We're here for the money.

1073
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,630
各位乡绅受惊了
Sorry for the intrusion!

1074
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,110
我们今天就是来找几个人
We're looking for...

1075
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:49,870
黄四郎！城南两大家族！站出来
Huang, heads of families, show yourselves!

1076
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,270
胡万？
Hu Wan?

1077
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,590
神父 打扰了
Father, our apologies.

1078
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:02,590
各位父老
Ladies and gentlemen,

1079
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,510
剩下的事情就与你们无关了
the rest has nothing to do with this.

1080
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:05,630
再见
Leave!

1081
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,950
入袋
Gag them!

1082
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,550
起来
Get up!

1083
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,270
好汉！我是本县县长
I'm the governor of this county.

1084
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,420
要绑 绑我吧
I volunteer to be your hostage.

1085
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,620
你不说话不行吗！
Just shut up!

1086
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,430
留着你的命 活着替我们收钱
We spare you to deliver our ransom.

1087
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,350
三天之内 钱到 放人
Three days, pay up and they go home.

1088
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,950
钱不到 撕票打死我吧
- If not, they die. - Shoot me first!

1089
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,430
别打别打！打死我！
- Stop it! - Shoot me first!

1090
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,430
找打是吧
You're asking for it.

1091
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,030
打…！
Beat him up!

1092
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,830
你怎么这么多嘴啊！
You talk too much!

1093
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,230
让你多嘴
I'll teach you a lesson!

1094
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,830
你装模做样的带我的九筒干什么
Stop messing with my mask!

1095
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:36,750
别把事给我办砸了！
Don't screw things up.

1096
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:37,990
带走！
Take them away!

1097
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,340
-是他！     -老三！
- It's him. - Three!

1098
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,510
装箱
Pack them!

1099
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:44,990
不见钱不放人啊！
No one goes until we get his ransom.

1100
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,870
千哥 忍着！
Butler, stay calm!

1101
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,270
One, two, three...

1102
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,110
黄四郎在里头
Huang is in there!

1103
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,950
One, two, three...

1104
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,510
你抱着我夫人学我哭的时候
You plotted this scheme

1105
00:56:58,680 --> 00:56:59,590
就想到这招了
over my wife's dead body?

1106
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,670
有粗有细啊！
I am impressed!

1107
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,710
三天之内 钱不到就撕票！
We'll kill the hostages in 3 days!

1108
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,550
记着 我是九筒！
Remember, I am Nine!

1109
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,950
这活办的真麻利！
That was quite a show.

1110
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,510
-像真的吗？     -像！
- Almost pass for real! - Sure.

1111
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,190
要是有人再流点血就更像真的了！
It'll be more convincing with some blood.

1112
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,340
对！
Right!

1113
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,190
有这个必要吗？
Was that necessary?

1114
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,710
有这个必要吗？有这个必要吗？
Was that really necessary?

1115
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,950
给我打！给我狠狠打！
Shoot! Give them hell!

1116
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,350
千爷 别打了
Butler, hold your fire!

1117
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,350
赶紧回去备银子吧！
We need time to prepare the ransom.

1118
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,150
三天收不到钱 麻匪可是要撕票的！
Otherwise they will kill the hostages.

1119
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:40,350
撕！让他们撕！
Let them kill the hostages.

1120
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:42,860
一定要让他们撕
In fact, I want them dead!

1121
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,870
替身就是为我干这个的
Why do you think I need a double?

1122
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,310
这个钱 我一分钱都不出！
I'll not pay any ransom.

1123
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:50,510
不过两大家族的钱
But the families will pay up.

1124
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:52,310
一定会过你们的手
You'll get your money for sure.

1125
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,350
弟弟
Brother,

1126
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,550
不要为我担心啊！
I'm fine.

1127
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,070
千万不要为我担心！
Don't worry about me.

1128
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,230
老爷 我怀疑胡万投靠了张麻子
Hu Wan must have defected to Zhang.

1129
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,350
一定要找到胡万！
He must be found,

1130
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,270
活要见人 死要见尸
dead or alive!

1131
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:10,550
替身这么有用啊！得空帮我也找一个
A double is useful. Find me one, too.

1132
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,280
张麻子 你真是没羞没臊
Pocky, have you no shame?

1133
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:14,710
玩砸了！
The game's up!

1134
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,390
砸了吗？
Really?

1135
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,510
砸了
Yes, game's up.

1136
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:20,710
我怎么觉得…刚开始啊！
The fun has only just begun.

1137
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:22,630
阿门！
Amen!

1138
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,030
放人！
Release them.

1139
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,660
给你们留个纪念 不准回头 滚！
Here's a souvenir. Don't look back. Scram!

1140
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,950
夫人 你要是晚走两天
Ma'am, if you're still alive,

1141
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,110
就能亲眼看见了
you'd see this for yourself.

1142
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,990
嫂子要是不走 这钱都到不了这桌上
If she was alive, there'll be nothing here.

1143
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:53,030
对 我老婆的命换来的这些钱
She traded her life for this.

1144
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,910
那我们家小六子的命不算命啊？
Doesn't Six's life count?

1145
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:55,830
那不一样！
It's different.

1146
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:56,830
怎么就不一样啊？
Goddamned it isn't!

1147
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,670
夫人！
My wife.

1148
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,350
谁夫人啊？
Whose wife?

1149
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,190
我夫人！
Mine.

1150
00:58:59,360 --> 00:58:59,870
你夫人怎么了？
What about her?

1151
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,950
夫人是被黄四郎杀死的
She was murdered by Huang.

1152
00:59:02,120 --> 00:59:05,110
你们家六爷自残 自杀！
But Six died at his own hands.

1153
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:06,790
我一枪崩了你
I'll shoot you dead,

1154
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,910
你敢说我们家小六子 找死啊！
for demeaning our Six!

1155
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,430
老二你把枪放下
Two, put down your gun.

1156
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:11,620
别拿枪对着我
Stop pointing your gun at me!

1157
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,950
我见过土匪 没见过练块的土匪
I've never seen bandits as dumb as you!

1158
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:18,870
笑什么啊 别笑 别笑！
Stop laughing! Cut it out.

1159
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,910
我是说你们家六爷 你们家六爷这样
I didn't belittle Six! He had courage!

1160
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:23,140
那是英雄
He was a hero!

1161
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,670
是 是英雄
Yes, he was heroic.

1162
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:31,020
我老婆睡着觉 就没醒过来
My wife went to sleep and died in bed.

1163
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,990
师爷不哭 嫂子也是英雄
Don't cry! Your wife was heroic, too.

1164
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,190
各位哥哥 咱们为什么来了？
Brothers, why are we here?

1165
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,190
钱啊
To get rich!

1166
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:37,990
钱到了吗？
Have we succeeded?

1167
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,220
到了
Yes, we have.

1168
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:40,830
走啊！
So let's leave!

1169
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,590
走啊
Let's go.

1170
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:42,510
那你还哭什么呀？
Why are you still in tears?

1171
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,350
我可以不哭
I'm overjoyed.

1172
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:44,910
大哥 什么时候走？
Chief, when do we leave?

1173
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,670
不走！
We're not.

1174
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,030
钱不是黄四郎送来的
This is not Huang's money.

1175
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,110
大哥 两大家族的钱不算钱啊？
But the money's still good!

1176
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,630
我要的是黄四郎的钱！
I want Huang's fortune.

1177
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,830
你不刮穷人的钱 也不要大户的钱…
You refuse to take money from rich or poor...

1178
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,700
六子 夫人 两条命
The blood debt of Six and Madam,

1179
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,030
必须黄四郎来偿！
must be repaid by Huang!

1180
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,550
你这是玩命啊！赌徒！
You're gambling with our lives!

1181
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:10,830
这就算赌了？
You call this a gamble?

1182
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,030
算！就是！还赌不赢
Yes, and you'll end up a loser!

1183
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,700
人不走
We're not leaving.

1184
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,270
钱也都不要了！
We don't want this money either.

1185
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,390
发出去！
Give them away.

1186
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,820
可是 大哥
But Chief...

1187
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,870
这钱你都发给谁呢？
Who do you want to give this to?

1188
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:28,350
发给穷人呗！
To the poor.

1189
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,270
那谁是穷人啊？
Who are the poor?

1190
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,350
谁穷 谁就是穷人
Those in dire need.

1191
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,590
劫我的时候 你戴的就是九筒
You wore "Nine" when you ambushed me.

1192
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,790
我这是多少？
What am I wearing now?

1193
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,180
你自己摸摸
Feel it for yourself.

1194
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,790
一筒
"One"!

1195
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:05,350
过瘾吗？
Fun, isn't it?

1196
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:06,430
过瘾！
Brilliant!

1197
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,070
你不就是想当老天爷吗？
Haven't you always wanted to play God?

1198
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:08,910
是啊
Yes.

1199
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,430
这跟收拾黄四郎有什么关系呀？
What has it got to do with Huang?

1200
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,750
老天爷都能当 还收拾不了一个黄四郎？
If I am God, ridding him should be a piece of cake.

1201
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,950
这个 我认识
I think I know her.

1202
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,260
我也认识
So do I!

1203
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,910
给她发点钱吧
Let's give her some money.

1204
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,110
干什么呀？
Hang on!

1205
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,950
大哥说了 发穷人！她不穷
She is not exactly poor, is she?

1206
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:38,310
那你说 谁算穷人？
So who are the poor?

1207
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,990
穷人？那就得被逼得卖儿卖女！
Those who're forced to sell their own children.

1208
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:45,270
她 就是被穷人卖掉的女儿！
Correct! She was sold by her parents.

1209
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,790
对呀！
Make sense!

1210
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:02,840
原来县长的人是麻匪！
So you're bandits in disguise!

1211
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,630
我们就想给你发点钱！
We've come to give you money.

1212
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,390
杀！必须的！
Kill her. No option!

1213
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:16,830
见过麻匪真面目的 必死无疑！
Whoever sees a bandit's face has to die.

1214
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,510
这可是你下的令
It's your own rule.

1215
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,870
师爷
Counselor.

1216
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:22,750
第一个见过麻匪真面目的人
The first to see our faces

1217
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,230
是你！
was you!

1218
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,260
事还没办呢就起内讧！
Our mission is only half accomplished,

1219
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,510
还为了一个女人
and we're bickering over a broad!

1220
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,950
我进城那天 带头敲鼓的是你吧
You're the lead drummer at my inauguration?

1221
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,860
姑娘 贵姓？
What's your name?

1222
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,230
不客气 花姐
Call me Flora.

1223
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:55,590
不是姓黄吧？
Are you related to Huang?

1224
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,590
不姓！是黄四郎把我买来的
No, he bought me.

1225
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,030
城门口贴的那些告示
There are posters by the city gate.

1226
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:04,990
知道是什么意思吧？
Know what they're for?

1227
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,270
通缉张麻子的
Bounty offers for "Pocky" Zhang.

1228
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,380
我就是张麻子
I am "Pocky" Zhang.

1229
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,790
麻匪发的 铁证如山！
The bandits were behind this.

1230
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,550
用面具的就是麻匪？我们也有面具
Is it because of the masks? We have masks too!

1231
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,270
那就是县长？
Then it must be the Governor!

1232
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,950
有钱不赚 发给穷人
He is giving money to the poor?

1233
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,600
这像是个买官的县长做的事吗？
No bogus governor would do that.

1234
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:38,030
今天 我要你们扮成麻匪
I want you to dress up as bandits.

1235
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,830
跟他们一模一样
Exactly like them.

1236
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,830
他们怎么发 你们就怎么抢！
What they give out, you take away.

1237
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,180
搞乱他们！
Let's cause havoc!

1238
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,510
明白！
Understood.

1239
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:48,790
三步棋必治他于死地
I'll have him checkmate in 3 moves!

1240
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:52,430
老爷 三步棋 咱们都已经走完了
But we've made 3 moves already.

1241
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:53,630
是吗？
Really?

1242
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,670
逼死小六子 杀鸡取卵…
Driving Six to death,
killing the chicken for the eggs...

1243
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,230
那是老三步了
Those were old moves!

1244
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,430
现在我要走的新三步
I'm talking about 3 new moves!

1245
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:02,550
第一步 到省城查清马邦德
First, check out the Governor.

1246
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:05,870
我总觉得他不像是个买官的县长
He doesn't act like someone who'd buy a post.

1247
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:08,870
起码 不姓马！
At least, he's not Ma Bangde.

1248
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:11,550
胡万的事怎么样了？
Have you found Hu Wan?

1249
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,430
胡万？还没找到
Hu Wan? Not yet.

1250
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,310
你怎么可能说还没有找到
How come he is still missing?

1251
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,630
老爷你放心 我会去找他 继续找
Don't worry, sir. I'll find him.

1252
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,070
你晓不晓得…
Do you know...

1253
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,510
我多么的想他
how much I miss him?

1254
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,750
黄老爷盼咐我们把他们搞乱
On master's order, let's wreak havoc!

1255
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:43,430
看老子怎么把他们搞乱
Let's show how we can mess things up!

1256
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,630
收到银子了？
Did you get your share?

1257
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:48,270
收到了
Yes.

1258
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,870
那你打算怎么感谢我们
How are you going to thank us?

1259
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:54,750
怎么感谢都…都行
Any way you like.

1260
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,630
怎么感谢都行？你说的！好！
Any way I like? Great, you said it!

1261
01:05:00,320 --> 01:05:03,750
知道我们…为什么会给你发银子吗？
Know why we gave you money?

1262
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,640
因为麻匪爷对我们好
It is because you're benevolent.

1263
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:07,940
对你好？
Benevolent?

1264
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:09,750
还没好透！
We can do even better!

1265
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,580
透！透！透！
Batter! Batter!

1266
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,990
青天大老爷做主啊！
Governor, we want justice!

1267
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:34,190
砸了你们！砸了！
It's all over! We're finished!

1268
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,270
兔子都知道不吃窝边草
Even rabbits wouldn't do this.

1269
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,940
六个人 还当着人家丈夫
Six men, in front of her husband,

1270
01:05:40,120 --> 01:05:41,230
还让人看
and in broad daylight!

1271
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,350
呸！恶心
Disgusting!

1272
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,030
我都关着灯！
I've never even done this with lights on!

1273
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,350
这种事你们可以花点钱嘛！
If you're desperate, paid for it!

1274
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,950
花点！
Be extravagant!

1275
01:05:50,320 --> 01:05:51,910
哪怕嫖呢！
Visit a brothel!

1276
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,750
花不了多少钱！
It won't cost much!

1277
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,390
哪怕偷偷摸摸的
You don't even have to be discreet.

1278
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,030
简直就是土匪
This is stupid!

1279
01:05:58,200 --> 01:05:59,910
土匪都不如！
You're worse than bandits!

1280
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,110
还说让人家百姓夸你们好
And we'd wanted to leave a good impression!

1281
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,350
就是一句话！恶心！
One word comes to mind: revolting!

1282
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,310
钱肯定是挣不着了！
Our scheme is now in ruin!

1283
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,510
恶心！恶心！
Disgusting!

1284
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,990
恶心呐！恶心！
Filthy, nauseating...

1285
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:14,790
呸！太恶心！
Revolting!

1286
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,550
大哥 你是了解我的
You know me.

1287
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:29,150
我从来不做仗势欺人的事
When it comes to this sort of thing,

1288
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,390
我喜欢被动
I prefer to be passive...

1289
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,110
大哥你是了解我的
You know me,

1290
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,870
以我的习惯
I am a lone wolf,

1291
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:38,430
万事不求人
always acting on my own.

1292
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,950
大哥 你是了解我的
You know me,

1293
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,390
如果是我…
If it was me,

1294
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,030
不会有人活着来告状
she wouldn't have lived to squeal.

1295
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:48,700
大哥你是了解我的
You know me.

1296
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,550
我老五虽然岁数最大
I may be the eldest,

1297
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,870
我…我至今…
but I am...

1298
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,110
俗称处男
still a virgin.

1299
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,780
别看着我呀
Stop staring at me!

1300
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,950
大哥 你是了解我的
You know me well.

1301
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:05,630
如果我出手…
If I was responsible,

1302
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,350
那趴在桌子上的
the one on the receiving end,

1303
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,630
应该是她老公
would have been her husband!

1304
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:19,630
我听出来了 你们都个个身怀绝技
Each of you is so unique.

1305
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:22,940
但是…
But...

1306
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,070
有人骗了我
I've been betrayed.

1307
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,380
谁呀？谁呀？
By who?

1308
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:27,940
老汤
Tang!

1309
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,110
这么明显的事 一个师爷看不出来？
How could he overlook the obvious?

1310
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,510
这明明是黄四郎狗狼养的找人冒充的
Huang is behind this scam.

1311
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,990
他今天很反常
Tang's not behaving properly.

1312
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,950
心里一定有鬼
He must be up to something.

1313
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:42,230
出来！起来！站起来！
Come out! Stand up!

1314
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,790
你最近跟什么人吃过饭？
Who have you been seeing lately?

1315
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:53,020
见过黄四郎？
Master Huang?

1316
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,190
不许动！举起腿来！
Don't move! Raise your legs.

1317
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:55,870
谁？！孩子！孩子
- Who's there? - A boy, my child!

1318
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,110
孩子？我的！
- Your child? - Yes, mine.

1319
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,140
你是个孩子？
You're a child?

1320
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:00,630
几岁？八岁！
- How old are you? - Eight!

1321
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:02,140
出来！
Come out!

1322
01:08:05,160 --> 01:08:06,300
这是八岁？!
He's eight?

1323
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:08,150
没人信！我都不信！
I find it hard to believe myself!

1324
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,710
三岁跟他妈一样高
As tall as Mom when he was three.

1325
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:12,510
五岁就跟我一样高 八岁就这样了
Taller than me when he was five...

1326
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,190
你妈！你妈！
Screw you!

1327
01:08:16,360 --> 01:08:17,070
妈！妈！
Mom, mom!

1328
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:18,350
你妈！
Screw you!

1329
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:19,710
敢打俺娃！
Hands off my boy!

1330
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,150
-你妈！     -你妈！
- Screw you! - Screw you, too!

1331
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:24,710
你妈！
Screw you!

1332
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:27,950
这是你亲妈？
She's your mother?

1333
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:28,910
是我妈
Yes, she is.

1334
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:29,750
这是你亲爹？
And he's your dad?

1335
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,270
我家的事关你屁事啊！你妈！
None of your goddamned business.

1336
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:33,990
你妈！
Stop it!

1337
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,830
嫂子！怎么回事？
Ma'am, what's going on?

1338
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,030
我是来要钱的 不给钱我不走
I come for money. I won't leave until he pays.

1339
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,180
不给钱不走
He owes you?

1340
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:43,270
这个老骗子 八年前在俺山西开矿
It was eight years ago in Shanxi.

1341
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,310
骗了钱我就不说了 还骗了我的身子
This crook made me pregnant.

1342
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:47,710
还不讲信誉
He is a man of poor repute.

1343
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,150
他欠一屁股帐
Ran up a mountain of debts,

1344
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,350
拍屁股走了
then vanished without trace.

1345
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,310
人家问俺追帐 把我六岁的娃给绑了
Creditors kidnapped my younger son.

1346
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,790
当人质呢 不给钱就撕票了！
He'll die if I don't clear his debts.

1347
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:56,590
那不是我的
He's not my child!

1348
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:57,740
那就是你的
He is!

1349
01:08:57,960 --> 01:08:59,100
不是我的就是你的！
- He isn't. - He is!

1350
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,230
是你的 我算着日子呢！
He is! I counted the days!

1351
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:04,750
他骗了人家钱
He swindled someone.

1352
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,060
人家到你那去要帐
His victims tracked you down,

1353
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,830
把你的小儿子绑架了
and kidnapped your younger son.

1354
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,430
不给钱就撕票
Threatening death...

1355
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,430
撕票 所以我要钱呢！
Yes, so I need the money.

1356
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:12,670
给钱！
Pay her.

1357
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,380
钱 石头！
Money! The stones...

1358
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,750
嫂子 初次见面
Just a small gift,

1359
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,550
不成敬意
to mark our acquaintance.

1360
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,580
石头我不要 不给钱我不走
I don't want these. I want real money.

1361
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,150
你个傻…
You stupid idiot...

1362
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:27,140
这比钱值钱！这是宝石
These diamonds are worth a fortune!

1363
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,230
啊！真的！
No kidding?

1364
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,140
自行车
Bicycle!

1365
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:34,230
这就能骑？
I can ride that?

1366
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,230
我们在上海骑过！
We rode one once in Shanghai.

1367
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:37,990
你们俩去过上海？
You have been to Shanghai?

1368
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,110
浦东
Pudong!

1369
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,190
不信 骑上准倒！
I'm sure you'd fall over.

1370
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,510
来！试试！
Come on. Try it.

1371
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:49,660
上来
Hop on!

1372
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:54,110
走 走了！
Let's go!

1373
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:03,950
自行车！
Bicycle!

1374
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,430
自行车！
Bicycle!

1375
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:12,430
可是 人肉的自行车
made of flesh and bones...

1376
01:10:14,440 --> 01:10:15,950
我来错地方了？
Have I come to the wrong place?

1377
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,270
我来的不是时候？
Or at the wrong time?

1378
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:19,350
接客
Serve your customers.

1379
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:20,270
他们俩都是
They're my customers.

1380
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:22,630
我们可是先来的
We're here first.

1381
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:23,670
付钱了吗？
Have they paid?

1382
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,830
自行车能算钱吗？
The "bicycle ride" doesn't count.

1383
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:27,870
送客！
Show them out.

1384
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,830
上次我给过你很多钱
But I've paid my dues.

1385
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:32,660
什么钱？
With what?

1386
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,190
窗户外边扔进来的银子？
Money you received through the window?

1387
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,830
那不是麻匪扔进来的吗？
Isn't that bandit money?

1388
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,700
难道他们俩是麻匪？
I wonder if they are also bandits.

1389
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,790
他们不是麻匪 他们是官府的人
No, they work for the Governor.

1390
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,500
你敢拿麻匪的钱给他们付帐？
How dare you pay their tab with bandit money?

1391
01:10:49,680 --> 01:10:51,550
别废话！先把人放了 快点！
Cut the crap! Let her go!

1392
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:55,830
英雄救美！
White knights to the rescue!

1393
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,350
英雄救美！
White knights to the rescue!

1394
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,430
就算他们是英雄 我也不是美人
I'm no damsel in distress.

1395
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,870
就算我是美人 他们也不是英雄
They're no knights in shining armour.

1396
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,030
老爷 毕竟他们是客人
After all, they're customers.

1397
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:37,230
今天晚上的钱 我替他们付了
I've already settled their bills.

1398
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,110
您不是常教育我们吗
You taught me yourself,

1399
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:41,070
客人永远是上帝
customers are always supreme!

1400
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:42,910
您说对口马？
Isn't that right?

1401
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:47,830
对！
Yes!

1402
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,580
对！
Correct!

1403
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:08,950
这就不是英雄救美了
Instead of knights coming to your rescue,

1404
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:11,710
是美救英雄
they are being saved by a damsel.

1405
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:17,150
你呀 快成小凤仙儿了
You're turning into a Mata Hari.

1406
01:12:29,680 --> 01:12:30,790
你得罪他了！
You've just pissed him off.

1407
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:32,310
黄四郎不用得罪
He doesn't need to be pissed off.

1408
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,950
他想让谁死
If he wants you dead,

1409
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,550
谁就得死！
you die!

1410
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,550
我刚才干嘛不一枪打死他呢？
I should've put a bullet through his head.

1411
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,430
我一枪打死他不就完了么！
That would be the end of it.

1412
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,070
别傻了！
Don't be silly.

1413
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,270
大哥说了 留着他是要弄他的钱
Chief wants to go after his fortune.

1414
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:48,270
既然想弄钱 那…
If you're here for the money, then...

1415
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,550
你们干嘛到处发钱啊？
why are you giving it away?

1416
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:52,790
这颜色行么
Is this the right colour?

1417
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,270
把伞拿了
Lower the umbrella.

1418

先是绿 再弄红
First apply green, then red.

1420
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:01,430
明白
Okay, got it.

1421
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,910
明白这意思吧？
Understand?

1422
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,500
你把那锁好了啊
Don't forget to lock up.

01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:13,750
大哥你看我…
Chief, how do I look?

1426
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,830
头不用梳了 脸够红 你过来！
Hair is fine. Face is flushed. Come here...

1427
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:19,430
死人的脸是绿的 加上点别的色
Apply that to a dead man's face

1428
01:13:19,640 --> 01:13:20,860
然后再变成这种红
will turn it into pinkish red.

1429
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,590
明白了明白了日巴
- Got it. - Good.

1430
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:23,670

你过来
Come here.

1432
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:27,790
绿在底下
Green is the base colour.

1433
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:30,110
加上那个再变成这个就对了！
Add that and you'll get this!

1434
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,870
-明白了     -明白吗
- Oh, I see... - Got it?

1435
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:33,950

You want shovels like these?

1436
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,180
锯短 装包里
Shorten them and put them in the bag.

1437

Short enough for the bag.

What's with the make-up?

1442
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:43,190
不是要跑吧？
Are you leaving for good?

1443
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:47,550
你去不去？我们去发钱
Come with us to give out money?

1444
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,910
糟践东西 不去！
No, what a waste!

1445
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,030
不去是吧不去
- So you're not coming? - No.

1446

我这次去 可能回得来
This time, I may come back,

1448
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:58,910

我要是回来 你就跟我跑
If I do, you can leave with us.

1451
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,910
去…去哪啊？不是发钱吗？
Aren't you just giving out money?

1452
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:06,990
是发钱
Yes, we are.

1453
01:14:07,160 --> 01:14:08,350

他要找你聊什么
Engage him in conversation.

1457
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,150
你就跟他聊什么
Whatever the topics,

1458

他怎么聊 你就怎么聊
just chat along with him.

1459
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,030
但是…
But...

1460
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,110
要慢 沉住气
you have to stay calm,

1461
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:29,350
越慢越好
make it nice and slow.

1462
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:30,990
你亲眼看见的？
You saw it with your own eyes?

1463
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:32,070
我亲眼看见的！
Indeed.

1464
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:36,060
你亲眼看见县长亲自带队出发？
You saw the Governor leading his men out?

1465
01:14:36,280 --> 01:14:36,950
我亲眼看见了！
Yes, with my own eyes.

1466
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,310
你亲眼看见县长亲自带队出发去发钱？
They've gone to give out money?

1467
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:40,550
我亲眼看见了！
Yes, indeed.

1468
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,750
他戴的是几筒？
Which mask does he wear?

1469
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:42,510
九筒！
"Nine".

1470
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:46,590
好极了！今晚不抢钱 杀人！
Splendid. Tonight we shall only kill!

1471
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:47,390
杀谁？
Our target?

1472
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:48,710
戴九筒的县长！
The Governor, wearing "Nine"!

1473
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,500
杀县长不用戴面具 您等着验尸吧
Masked or not, consider this done!

1474
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:54,750
回来！全给我戴上！
All of you, put on your masks!

1475
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:57,430
麻匪火拼
"Firefight with bandits,

1476
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:00,230
县长暴死
intrepid Governor killed!"

1477
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:04,900
听着多么顺耳！
That would be music to my ears!

1478
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,430
看清楚了 他们领头的戴几筒？
Which mask is their leader wearing?

1479
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:17,700
九筒！
"Nine".

1480
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,630
全都换上四筒！
Let's all change to "four"!

1481
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:23,630
四筒是自己人 其他人全打死
Kill anyone who is not a "four"!

1482
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,790
那边领头的戴的是几筒 看见了吗？
Which mask is their leader wearing?

1483
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,100
四筒
"Four".

1484
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:28,910
那咱们应该戴几筒 你知道吗？
Know what we'll be wearing, then?

1485
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:29,990
明白
Got it.

1486
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,190
先弄死九筒！走！
Let's get rid of "Nine"!

1487
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:55,070
黄老爷 你怎么在这啊？
Master Huang, what brings you here?

1488
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,790
县衙我不能来吗？
Can I not visit the magistracy?

1489
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,550
点上
Light it!

1490
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,950
你们玩空城计 我就趁虚而入！
When the cat prowls, the mouse seizes control!

1491
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:08,350
坐
Sit down!

1492
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:13,350
县长呢？
Where's the Governor?

1493
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,550
都是四筒 下不了手啊！
Everyone is a "Four"? I'm confused!

1494
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:21,670
下不了手
I'm confused, too!

1495
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:23,950
打雷天站在雨里头有点不讲究
It's bad to stay out in a thunderstorm.

1496
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:24,990
太不讲究！
Yes, it's awful.

1497
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,030
那改天再约 撤吧
Let's reschedule. Split!

1498
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,150
撤！
Be in touch!

1499
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,230
怎么撤？
What now?

1500
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:30,710
从哪儿来 回哪儿去呗
It's back to square one.

1501
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,630
好 从哪儿来 回哪儿去
Yes, square one.

1502
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,260
一二三 撤！
Split! 1, 2, 3.

1503
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,630
听 枪一响 就有人死
Listen! Someone's been shot.

1504
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,630
有人死 就有人哭
Soon someone will mourn.

1505
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:56,940
人一哭 就要说心里话
Mourning will lead to confessions.

1506
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:00,150
说吧
Confess!

1507
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:04,030
你至少有三句要说
You've at least three confessions to make.

1508
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,990
我不该拿你的钻石送人
I shouldn't have given your diamonds away.

1509
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,110
不是这句
Try again.

1510
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,910
杀人诛心是我说的
I suggested "to kill someone,
first destroy his soul".

1511
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:21,430
也不是这句
Not that either.

1512
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:28,710
鸿门宴要是我们请就好了
We should have hosted the banquet instead.

1513
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:30,990
鸿门宴？
The banquet?

1514
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,180
听不见
I can't hear you.

1515
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,060
听不见！
I can't hear you!

1516
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:43,300
城里麻匪火拼
There was a shoot-out.

1517
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,670
死了六个人！咱们的人安然无恙！
Six killed. We're unscathed.

1518
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,230
师爷 来来 请
Counselor, come take a look.

1519
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,550
或许…是你的恩人呐
Your saviour may be among them.

1520
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,830
您才是我的恩人
No, you are my saviour.

1521
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,830
既然我是你的恩人
If that is the case,

1522
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,630
那就听恩人的话 揭开看看
remove his mask,

1523
01:18:11,800 --> 01:18:12,630
去吧 看看！
and have a good look.

1524
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:14,910
来！照上照上！
Come on, lights!

1525
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,350
什么情况？
What's going on?

1526
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,550
什么情况？什么情况？
What's happening here?

1527
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:29,020
胡万！
It's Hu Wan!

1528
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,510
胡…胡万？
Hu Wan?

1529
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,110
怎么会是胡万？
How come it's Hu Wan?

1530
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:34,230
怪了
This is weird!

1531
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:36,110
四筒啊
All those wearing "four"

1532
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:37,340
全是黄家的人！
are my men!

1533
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:39,550
麻匪呢？
Where are the bandits?
Where are they?

1534
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,550
胡万 就是麻匪！
Hu Wan was a bandit!

1535
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:45,020
麻匪 就是胡万！
He was one of them!

1536
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,910
杀县长夫人 绑架豪绅
Murderers and kidnappers,

1537
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:51,150
祸害鹅城百姓
those who terrorised Goose Town,

1538
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:54,830
就是你黄老爷家的胡万！
were led by your own Hu Wan!

1539
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,830
我说你为什么不出钱剿匪？
I wondered why you didn't fund the expedition.

1540
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,310
原来你是贼喊捉贼啊！
You may even be the bandit chief himself!

1541
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,190
你拿枪指着我？
You dare to turn your guns on me?

1542
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,510
你拿枪指着我？!
You dare to turn your guns on me?

1543
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,910
你想跟我火拼？
Do you want a shoot-out?

1544
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,140
你们看到了没有！这是当麻匪的下场！
Take a good look at a bandit's fate!

1545
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,700
就算是我亲爹也得死！
I'd still have him shot

1546
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:22,510
死有余辜！
if he was my father...

1547
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,030
早晚！
sooner or later!

1548
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,990
麻匪胡万又让黄老爷枪毙了五回
You just shot Hu Wan 5 more times.

1549
01:19:33,160 --> 01:19:34,190
大义灭亲？
You want to show justice?

1550
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,910
杀人灭口？
Or to make sure he's dead?

1551
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:40,790
杀人灭口 你就是麻匪的头子张麻子
Only "Pocky" Zhang would want to silence him.

1552
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,590
要是大义灭亲 那好办！
If you'd only wanted to show justice,

1553
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,590
你出钱 我剿匪！

三天之后 一定给县长一个惊喜

汤师爷 他是胡万的恩人

我让你翻译给我听 什么叫惊喜
What on earth is a "nice surprise"?

1563
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:11,870
不用翻译 就是惊喜啊
It is what it is.

1564
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,260
难道你听不懂什么叫惊喜
You just don't get it, do you?

1565

我就想让你翻译翻译 什么叫惊喜！

小弟我愿意等你三天

1583
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,950
黄老爷
Master Huang.

1584
01:20:59,240 --> 01:21:01,800
汤师爷是我的至爱
I adore my Counselor,

1585
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:05,110
你可不能夺我所爱啊
I can't let you have him.

1586
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,310
了然 了然
Fair enough.

1587
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,230
六子
Six.

1588
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,950
事已经办了九成了
We're almost there.

1589
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:23,390
算七成吧
Say, 70% done.

1590
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:25,590
今天我就派你二哥出城

1591
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:27,790
到青石岭去接应我们

1592
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,590
剩下的事 我会说到做到
I will keep my promise.

1593
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:36,830
你明白了吧？
Know what you have to do?

1594
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,670
明白
Yes.

1595
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,830
一百八十万两银子到手
When $1.8 million is in hand,

1596
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:47,230
我觉着小六子的仇算是报了
I'll consider Six avenged.

1597
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:50,110
我觉着啊！
I feel that...

1598
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,790
不光六子 夫人的仇也算报了
my wife's death is also avenged.

1599
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:02,150
你不会真跟黄四郎玩命吧 恩人呐
Saviour, you still want to kill Huang?

1600
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,510
我不是你恩人 黄四郎才是你恩人
I'm not your saviour. Huang is.

1601
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:09,310
你是恩人 他不是！
You're my saviour. Not him.

1602
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,870
你当时真的以为我死了？
Did you think I was lying dead back there?

1603
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:13,990
没有！绝对没有
No, of course not.

1604
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:14,670
没有？
Sure?

1605
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,390
从没这么想过！
Never crossed my mind.

1606
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:22,990
我可真算服了你了
I've to hand this to you.

1607
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:26,070
狸猫变太子 嘎登变出一胡万来
Abracadabra, and Hu Wan magically appeared!

1608
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,670
可是我有一事不明
But I really didn't get it.

1609
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:30,550
六具尸体
Those six bodies,

1610
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:32,350
这么长的距离 那么短的时间
such a distance, so little time,

1611
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,710
还抹着红脸蛋 你们是怎么搬来的？
how did you move them so quickly?

1612
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,030
我跟黄四郎可是一路小跑过来的
Huang and I took the shortcut.

1613
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:38,230
你们搬着六个人
You've to carry six bodies.

1614
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:39,870
来不及呀！
How did you manage?

1615
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,390
我为什么要把人埋在衙门里
They weren't buried at the magistracy.

1616
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:45,310
我把人就埋在了那！
The bodies were buried there all along.

1617
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:49,590
人埋在哪儿 事儿就出在哪儿！
I ensure the standoff was at their burial site.

1618
01:22:50,080 --> 01:22:53,510
事儿出在哪儿 黄四郎就得跟到哪儿！
That's where I led Huang to.

1619
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:57,990
那你真是张麻子
I'm convinced you're "Pocky" Zhang.

1620
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,910
坐！
Sit down.

1621
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,990
我姓张
My name is Zhang.

1622
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,030
知道
I know that.

1623
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,390
叫牧之
Zhang Muzhi.

1624
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,110
好名字！
A fine name!

1625
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,510
兖州牧 豫州牧
It has auspicious meanings.

1626
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:18,070
牧之 令尊是望子成大器
You father must have high hopes.

1627
01:23:18,600 --> 01:23:20,110
从讲武堂出来
After graduating from military academy,

1628
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:23,910
我追随过松坡将军
I enlisted in General Cai's army.

1629
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,390
给他做过手枪队长
Served as captain of his riflemen.

1630
01:23:26,760 --> 01:23:28,070
那年你多大？
How old were you then?

1631
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:29,510
十七
Seventeen.

1632
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:31,710
少年得志啊
A youthful genius!

1633
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:36,110
后来庐州会战 将军负了伤
Cai was wounded during the Battle of Luzhou,

1634
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:39,790
再后来 将军死在了日本
and later died in exile in Japan.

1635
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,270
我回来了
I came back alone.

1636
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:47,230
碰上军阀混战 天下大乱
The country was in total chaos.

1637
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,620
我只得浪迹江湖 落草为寇
So I became a bandit.

1638
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,190
牧之也被叫成了麻子
They nicknamed me "Pocky".

1639
01:23:56,120 --> 01:24:00,430
可惜啊！多好的一个牧字
Shame! You're so handsome.

1640
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,550
人们不愿意相信
People have an odd way of thinking,

1641
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:06,030
一个土匪的名字叫牧之
that bandits shouldn't have proper names.

1642
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,710
人们更愿意相信他叫麻子
They love calling their bandits "Pocky".

1643
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,790
人们特别愿意相信
Not only that,

1644
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:15,340
他的脸上应该长着麻子
they want their bandits scarred and scary.

1645
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,670
这人可真够操蛋的
People can be so ignorant.

1646
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,710
我的故事…却是这样…
My own story started like this...

1647
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:29,710
那年我也十七岁
I too was a tenderly 17,

1648
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,910
她也十七岁
and so was she.

1649
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:35,870
停！我不愿意听你的故事
Stop, I'm not interested.

1650
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,990
我一般不跟人说心里话
I don't confess to just anyone.

1651
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,230
这都到嘴边了 你不能让我咽回去吧
I've to continue now that I started.

1652
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:43,620
咽回去吧
Take it back!

1653
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,830
因为你说出来也是假的
It's all made up anyway.

1654
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,750
你是个骗子
You're a conman!

1655
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,590
北国我不知道
In our part of China,

1656
01:24:56,280 --> 01:25:00,990
在我南国 这样的珍藏版地雷
There are only two such landmines.

1657
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:02,910
只有两颗
Both limited edition.

1658
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,270
Made in USA 一九一零
Made in U.S.A. - 1910!

1659
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,990
砰！一响 它就没了
Bang and everything's in smithereens!

1660
01:25:24,680 --> 01:25:28,670
所以 不带走几条人命
So if it doesn't take some lives with it,

1661
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:33,350
那就是卑鄙的浪费！
it'd be such a waste.

1662
01:25:33,880 --> 01:25:35,020
那么…
Well...

1663
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,630
另外一颗地雷呢？
where's the other one?

1664
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:38,510
炸了！
It exploded.

1665
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:39,230
炸了？
Really?

1666
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,590
辛亥革命的第一响
The first bang during the 1911 Revolution!

1667
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,310
我知道了
Oh yes, I've heard!

1668
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:45,190
炸在辛亥这个地方了
It went off at Xinhai!

1669
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:50,750
辛亥不是个地方 是一种革命
Xinhai's not a place! It's a revolutionary icon!

1670
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,710
您要早这么说我就了然了
You should've said so earlier.

1671
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:54,750
那还是说说这颗吧
Now, tell me about this one.

1672
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:56,510
谁让你问那颗的？
You must stay focused.

1673
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:59,310
所以 它要炸得惊天
I want it to shake the world,

1674
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,950
还要动地 还要泣鬼神
I want it to rock and roll!

1675
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:03,870
了然
Understood.

1676
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,230
选个好地方
Pick a good spot,

1677
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,310
选个好时辰
find an auspicious time...

1678
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,310
那么…炸谁？
So, who's our target?

1679
01:26:09,520 --> 01:26:10,740
你应该问…
You should've asked...

1680
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:11,670
炸在哪
"Where"?

1681
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:13,150
炸在哪？
Where, then?

1682
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:15,270
剿匪的路上
Where the expedition force must pass.

1683
01:26:15,640 --> 01:26:17,940
这么快又要剿匪了？
Yet another expedition?

1684
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,790
那这回我能多分点吧
Can I have a bigger cut this time?

1685
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,950
你要是真的张麻子 钱都给你
You can have it all if you're the real Pocky!

1686
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,750
了然 我是假麻子！
No problem, sir. I'm a fake.

1687
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:27,070
老爷给我多少那是对我的恩赐
I'll take whatever you can spare.

1688
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,230
那么 什么时候炸？
When do you want it to blow up?

1689
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,630
什么时候炸那是第三步
That's our denouement!

1690
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:35,110
且让我把第二步慢慢走好
Let's play out our second act slowly.

1691
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:36,550
都别动！
Hold still!

1692
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,260
让她说！
Let her speak.

1693
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:40,710
老二不辞而别
Two left without saying goodbye.

1694
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:43,230
老三又要走了
Now Three is leaving too.

1695
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:45,270
我们活活的被你们拆散了！
You are tearing us apart!

1696
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:49,310
女侠 你是为了老二还是为老三啊？
You're doing this for Two or Three?

1697
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:50,870
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1698
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,430
你左手的意思我懂
I know your left hand's intention,

1699
01:26:53,640 --> 01:26:54,830
右手的意思我也懂
I know your right hand's intention.

1700
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,910
两只手这么待着 我看不懂
But both hands together...I don't get it.

1701
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:58,790
要么成 要么死
I'd rather be dead!

1702
01:26:58,960 --> 01:26:59,750
AB型！
Typical Scorpian!

1703
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,350
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1704
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:03,580
你们都坐下
Sit down, all of you.

1705
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,430
我再跟她聊聊
Let me talk to her.

1706
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,740
你是被黄四郎买来的
You were bought by Huang?

1707
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:10,510
对
Yes.

1708
01:27:10,680 --> 01:27:11,820
-他打过你吗？     -打过
- Been mistreated? - Yes.

1709
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,150
-我打过你么？     -没有
- Have I ever laid hands on you? - No.

1710
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,380
-你恨他吗？     -恨
- Hate him? - Yes.

1711
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:15,390
-恨我吗？     -不恨
- And me? - No.

1712
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:17,590
那你不拿枪指着他！你拿枪指着我？
Then why threaten me with a gun?

1713
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,390
因为你是好人
Because you're a good person.

1714
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,790
什么？
What?

1715
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,070
这是什么狗屁道理？
What kind of stupid logic is that?

1716
01:27:22,240 --> 01:27:23,990
好人就得让人拿枪指着？
You threaten me because I'm good?

1717
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,190
花姐 大哥说得对！
Flora, Chief is right!

1718
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,950
回来！坐下！
Go back! Sit down!

1719
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:30,670
你们这群王八蛋
You bunch of idiots!

1720
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,950
我让你们把钱发给穷人
I told you to give money to the poor.

1721
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,030
你们发给一个女人？
And you gave it to her?

1722
01:27:34,160 --> 01:27:36,620
我说什么来着？没人听啊！
I warned you but nobody listened.

1723
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:38,550
闭嘴！天生的老骗子！
Shut up! You're a born cheat!

1724
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,150
时时刻刻想骗我！
Always plotting to swindle me.

1725
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,150
跟黄四郎勾勾搭搭！
Working with Huang behind my back.

1726
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,390
一个土匪碰见一个恶霸
When a bandit confronts a godfather,

1727
01:27:44,600 --> 01:27:45,790
多么简单的事！
the outcome should be simple.

1728
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,910
让你们给弄成这么烂七八糟的
How can you screw up so badly?

1729
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,750
你还敢拿枪指着我？
How dare you still point your gun at me?

1730
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,510
不敢拿枪 当不了麻匪
If I don't dare to draw a gun on you,

1731
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,350
我敢拿枪指着你
I'll never make a good bandit.

1732
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,180
我胆儿大吧
I dare you all!

1733
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,790
你们谁给她出的这个主意？
Whose quirky idea is this?

1734
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,350
谁？
Whose?

1735
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:04,910
我就是跟她说着玩的
I was just teasing her.

1736
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:11,950
你是想当麻匪？
You want to become one of us?

1737
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,990
对呀！我想跟你们一块儿发钱
Yes, to give money out to the poor,

1738
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:18,070
把钱袋子扔到窗户里 听他们笑
to hear and share their joy.

1739
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:21,390
你现在就是了
You're now one of us.

1740
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:22,740
我还没准备好呢
But I am not prepared.

1741
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,990
不用准备
No need!

1742
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,350
你们都准备过吗？
Did you make preparation?

1743
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:26,390
没有
No.

1744
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:27,190
你准备过吗？
How about you?

1745
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,510
没有啊 我吃着火锅唱着歌
I was eating hotpot and singing songs.

1746
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,350
扑通一下掉水里 出来就到这儿了
My train plunged and I ended up here.

1747
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,590
我们要离开鹅城
We're leaving Goose Town soon.

1748
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:38,750
你就留在鹅城
But you have to stay.

1749
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:39,830
不！
No.

1750
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:42,350
当麻匪要听命令
A bandit must have discipline.

1751
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,950
大哥说得对
Chief is right.

1752
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:46,870
刚才说的也对
But she has a point, too.

1753
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:55,310
我有个很重要的事交给你
I have an important mission for you.

1754
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:57,830
我看你挺合适
I think you can manage.

1755
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:00,350
这就是惊喜！
This is our nice surprise!

1756
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:02,910
果然是个惊喜
A nice surprise indeed.

1757
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:05,150
果然他不姓马！
He is not Ma!

1758
01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:10,750
有了这个惊喜
Now that we know,

1759
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:17,230
我的第二步就能走的更加悠然
My next move can be more leisurely.

1760
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:18,790
悠然？
Leisurely?

1761
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,270
盗官欺爵 放在前清
Impersonating a governor
warrants capital punishment.

1762
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:24,150
满门抄斩
His whole clan dies with him!

1763
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,870
老爷 你等着
Master, just you wait.

1764
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:27,740
我这就一枪崩了他！
I'll go and blow him away!

1765
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:28,980
不！
No!

1766
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,190
他们死以前
Before they die,

1767
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,950
我还要好好地耍耍这两只猴！
I want to toy with these circus monkeys.

1768
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:34,270
我的老爷
But Master,

1769
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:36,590
这两只猴子不值得您耍！
they're not worth your while.

1770
01:29:36,760 --> 01:29:39,270
要耍！一定要耍！
No, I must toy with them!

1771
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,950
不耍猴 我怎么赚到两大家族的钱？
Otherwise, I couldn't get others to pay,

1772
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:47,150
不耍猴 他们怎么心甘情愿地去剿匪？
the Governor couldn't go and fight the bandits,

1773
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:51,710
不剿匪 他们怎么能踩到地雷呢？
and they wouldn't trot on my landmine!

1774
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,300
黄四郎有个替身
Huang has a double.

1775
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:54,830
跟他长得一模一样
They are indistinguishable.

1776
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:59,070
我弄不清楚他是黄四郎 还是他替身
I can't tell if this is really Huang.

1777
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:00,820
你帮我去看看
I need you to check for me.

1778
01:30:05,080 --> 01:30:06,060
假的！
He's a fake.

1779
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,070
他不是黄四郎
He's not Huang.

1780
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:10,270
我已经跟你们说过我不是他
Told you I'm not Huang!

1781
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,390
我真的不是他
I really am not him.

1782
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:13,230
肯定不是
I'm certain.

1783
01:30:13,400 --> 01:30:14,870
放了我吧 放了我
Let me go.

1784
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,110
那好 你帮我们看住他
Keep an eye on him until our return.

1785
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,910
等我们回来 就用你手里的枪
If you have to, use your guns.

1786
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,790
我不会用枪
I've never used a gun.

1787
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,590
老三 你教教她
Three, show her how.

1788
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,270
这照片是你吗？
Is that your photo?

1789
01:30:43,600 --> 01:30:44,430
是我！
Yes, it's mine.

1790
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:45,830
是吗？
Sure?

1791
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:47,110
是
Yes,

1792
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,270
那时候我还很瘦
I was slimmer then.

1793
01:30:50,760 --> 01:30:52,070
这就不是你
I don't think it's you.

1794
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,550
你说他不是我？
It isn't?

1795
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:54,590
不是！
No, it isn't.

1796
01:30:54,760 --> 01:30:56,230
我说他也不是我！
I don't think so either.

1797
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:58,630
这根本就不是我！
No, that ain't me.

1798
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:01,030
那到底是怎么回事？
What is this all about?

1799
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:03,150
我还想知道是怎么回事
I was totally baffled myself.

1800
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:07,270
花钱买了个县官 我总得有个证件吧
When I bought the post, I needed papers.

1801
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,870
我去照相馆照相 取照片的时候
I had my picture taken at a gallery,

1802
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,550
他们给我的就是这张
and that's what they gave me.

1803
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:14,910
我说这不是我 他们说这就是你
I said the man in the photo wasn't me.

1804
01:31:15,240 --> 01:31:18,750
我说他不是我！他们说这就是你
They insisted that it was.

1805
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,830
没办法 我就把它贴在这了
I've no choice but to use it.

1806
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:22,510
哦！是这样！
Is that so?

1807
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,270
哦什么呀？
Bullshit!

1808
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,510
这明明是我！
That's obviously me!

1809
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:28,710
我才是马邦德！
I am the real Ma Bangde.

1810
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:31,190
哦！是这样
Is that so?

1811
01:31:31,320 --> 01:31:34,940
是这样！我进城以前遇见麻匪
I was ambushed by bandits on my way here.

1812
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:37,670
幸亏有他 才躲过一劫
He saved my life.

1813
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:40,630
我一想 索性让他假扮县长
So I let him take the post.

1814
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:43,390
毕竟是自家外甥嘛
After all, he's my nephew.

1815
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,950
三舅 这话能跟他说吗？
Uncle, we shouldn't be telling him this.

1816
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:46,180
闭嘴！
Shut up!

1817
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,830
黄老爷见笑 马某走南闯北
I've travelled all over China,

1818
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,070
在九个地方做过县长
I have been governor in 9 counties.

1819
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:56,270
靠的就是以假乱真、鱼目混珠之章法
I excel in confusing facts with fiction!

1820
01:31:56,520 --> 01:31:58,150
那么…马县长…
So, Governor Ma...

1821
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,230
你说
Yes?

1822
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,310
叫我呐！
He's addressing me.

1823
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,020
黄老爷继续
You were saying?

1824
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,190
我刚摸清你们的底细
Just as I uncover the truth,

1825
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:07,710
你们就不打自招
you blow your own cover!

1826
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:08,630
太巧了吧？
What a coincidence.

1827
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:13,110
有道是 展颜消宿怨
"Stop frowning to dispel ill feelings,

1828
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,150
一笑泯恩仇啊
and brush aside quarrels with a smile."

1829
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:16,790
你想跟我和解？
Want to make peace?

1830
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,110
好啊！我的替身呢？
Splendid. Where's my double?

1831
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,270
还给我 前面的账一笔勾销
Return him and we'll call it quits.

1832
01:32:22,440 --> 01:32:23,630
撕票了
We've killed him.

1833
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,430
哪个王八蛋让你撕票的？
Which asshole ordered his execution?

1834
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:28,390
你个王八蛋让我撕票的！
You're that asshole!

1835
01:32:31,080 --> 01:32:32,910
开枪 你开枪我也能先打死你
I dare you to pull your trigger!

1836
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:34,550
放下！
Lay down your guns!

1837
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:37,150
开枪！你先开枪 我也能先打死你
I know I could take you out first.

1838
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,190
把枪放下！我数三下
Put down your guns on my count of three!

1839
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,070
一！二！三！
One, two, three!

1840
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,270
老黄 你先放下
Huang, put it down!

1841
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,150
他不懂事儿 你也不懂事啊？
He may be a brute, but you too?

1842
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:54,070
你最不懂事！
You're the worst!

1843
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:55,750
你们什么时候出城剿匪？
When are you leaving for your expedition?

1844
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,990
走不了
We aren't.

1845
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:58,550
钱不到手 出不了城
We can't leave without funding.

1846
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:00,110
出不了城 剿不了匪
We can't fight without leaving!

1847
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:02,830
黄老爷 您说话不算数啊！
You've failed to live up to your promise.

1848
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,350
鸿门宴上说得好
You had agreed to

1849
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:05,700
你带头出钱
Iead the contribution

1850
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,750
再套出两大家族的钱来
in order to make the others pay.

1851
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,550
可是你不但不出钱
Not only have you not put up any money,

1852
01:33:09,720 --> 01:33:12,950
还扮成麻匪跟我们打来打去 不仗义啊
you've also fought us posing as bandits!

1853
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:16,310
错！你们看见的麻匪 是我扮的
Wrong! You saw my men dressed up as bandits.

1854
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,870
我看见的麻匪 是你们扮的
I saw yours posing as bandits, too.

1855
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,510
可是他们看见的麻匪
But when the others see these bandits,

1856
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,430
他们以为是真的！
they wouldn't know that they're fakes.

1857
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,910
现在正是让他们出钱剿匪的好时机！
Now is the time to pay for the expedition.

1858
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:28,430
只要我出钱 他们一定会出
If I pay, others will follow suit.

1859
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,070
你的钱呢？
Where's your money?

1860
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,830
早已经为你准备好了
It's all here.

1861
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:43,030
鹅城到处都是我的钱
I've money stowed away everywhere!

1862
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:44,580
都在这儿？
It's all here?

1863
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:46,190
这只是一半
This is only half of my share.

1864
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:50,430
我们想赚多少 他们必须出多少
Each family will have to put up the same.

1865
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:51,860
三舅 有诈！
Uncle, this is a trap.

1866
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:53,780
诈？
A trap?

1867
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:56,910
来回这么多趟 死了这么多人
After all these confrontations,

1868
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:57,910
他一分钱都不出
he has not put up a dime.

1869
01:33:58,080 --> 01:33:59,990
今天怎么突然出了这么多钱？
Why so generous all of a sudden?

1870
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,190
你觉得突然？
Did I surprise you?

1871
01:34:02,040 --> 01:34:02,630
太突然了
Yes, you did.

1872
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:04,020
我也觉得突然
I surprised myself too!

1873
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,270
想知道吗？
Want to know why?

1874
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,820
过来
Come here.

1875
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,790
我要当…
I - want - to - be -

1876
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:11,790
县长
Governor!

1877
01:34:11,960 --> 01:34:13,020
你？
You?

1878
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:14,670
我做不了县长？
I won't make a Governor?

1879
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:16,790
我不像个县长？
Don't I look the part?

1880
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,550
像！我们一走 你就上任鹅城
Yes, you can swear in as soon as we leave.

1881
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,150
鹅城？
Goose Town?

1882
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:24,110
我买了六个县的县长！
I bought governorship of 6 more counties!

1883
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,510
我一个人当不过来
I can't handle all on my own!

1884
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:28,150
所以…
That is why...

1885
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:29,420
出去
Get out!

1886
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:31,310
退下
Leave us.

1887
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,230
老马 你来帮我当三个县的县长
I need you to govern three of them for me.

1888
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:37,670
好啊！这事我拿手
Brilliant! I'm good at governing.

1889
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:38,990
等会！
Hey, wait...

1890
01:34:39,160 --> 01:34:41,190
那…那我干什么呀？
What about me, then?

1891
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:42,550
你嘛…
You...

1892
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,630
来当一个假的张麻子！
can play "Pocky" Zhang!

1893
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:48,910
好啊
Great idea!

1894
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:25,830
自宣统皇帝退位以后
Since the abdication of the last Emperor,

1895
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,110
鹅城一共来过51任县长
Goose Town has 51 governors.

1896
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:33,590
他们都是王八蛋、禽兽、畜生、寄生虫
They're all bastards, parasites and leeches!

1897
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:36,750
但是这位马邦德县长
But our beloved Governor Ma,

1898
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,070
他不是王八蛋 不是畜生
is neither a bastard, parasite,

1899
01:35:39,240 --> 01:35:41,700
不是禽兽 也不是寄生虫
Ieech, nor a beast!

1900
01:35:41,880 --> 01:35:45,750
他今天亲自带队 出兵剿匪
He risks his life to combat the bandits.

1901
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:49,390
他是我们的大英雄
He is our hero!

1902
01:35:52,680 --> 01:35:53,900
师爷 请！
Counselor, please.

1903
01:35:56,880 --> 01:36:00,030
大风起兮云飞扬
It's time for heroes to take centre stage!

1904
01:36:00,240 --> 01:36:03,390
安得猛士兮走四方
It's time for heroes to show their mettle!

1905
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:07,070
麻匪 任何时候都要剿
We must rid ourselves of these bandits.

1906
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:08,790
不剿不行
We don't have a choice.

1907
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,790
你们想想 你带着老婆
Imagine, if you take your wife out,

1908
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,910
出了城 吃着火锅 还唱着歌
singing, eating hot pot and be merry,

1909
01:36:16,080 --> 01:36:19,270
突然就被麻匪劫了！
when bandits jump on you from nowhere!

1910
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,270
所以 没有麻匪的日子
I long for a world without thieves,

1911
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,550
才是好日子！
for days of wine and roses!

1912
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:26,990
县长 请！
Governor, please!

1913
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:31,350
出发！
March!

1914
01:36:46,200 --> 01:36:46,990
恩人
Saviour,

1915
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,670
给你看个宝贝
want to check this out?

1916
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,190
这不就是委任状嘛
Isn't that the warrant?

1917
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,670
念念 念念
Read it out loud.

1918
01:36:54,200 --> 01:36:56,790
兹委任马邦德…怎么了？
Ma Bangde is hereby appointed...

1919
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:57,830
后面！
Read on!

1920
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,710
中华民国八年八月…
8th month of the 8th year of the Republic...

1921
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,230
念你没念过的字 当中！
Don't miss out the words in between...

1922
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,790
兹委任马邦德为康城县长…
Ma Bangde is hereby appointed
Kang County governor...

1923
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,350
等会…
Hang on...

1924
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:08,430
康城？
Kang County?

1925
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:10,510
不是鹅城吗？
Not Goose Town?

1926
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,270
从来都是康城
It has always been Kang County.

1927
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:12,990
好小子
You bastard!

1928
01:37:13,160 --> 01:37:14,070
怨你啊
Blame yourself!

1929
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,990
你把我泡水里 九筒扣脸上
When you dumped me in the river,

1930
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:19,580
闹钟咔咔咔响 吓死我了！
scared as I was, I had an inspired moment.

1931
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,320
我灵机一动 让你去鹅城
I brought you to Goose Town.

1932
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,870
这鹅城和康城有什么不一样啊？
What's their difference?

1933
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,710
康城富饶 鹅城凶险
Kang County is affluent. Goose Town is deadly.

1934
01:37:28,880 --> 01:37:30,310
那你为什么让我去啊？
Why Goose Town for me?

1935
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:32,070
你鬼扯呗 截火车！
You're a tough cookie, aren't you?

1936
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:36,020
告诉你啊 你进了鹅城就有两种情况
There can only be two outcomes.

1937
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:39,230
第一 你进城就被黄四郎弄死
Either Huang kills you dead,

1938
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:41,310
我马走康城 从容上任
and I'll move on to Kang County.

1939
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,350
第二 你有种 咱俩办了黄四郎
Or we sort out Huang instead,

1940
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,780
就像现在这样
Iike what's happening now.

1941
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,910
好！说得好 马邦德
Very clever!

1942
01:37:48,080 --> 01:37:48,870
你这个骗子
You goddamned crook!

1943
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,870
早晚有一天你会被张麻子
One day Pocky will get you,

1944
01:37:51,040 --> 01:37:52,150
一枪崩了
and blast you to hell!

1945
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,150
你崩了我？
You won't.

1946
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:54,790
你舍不得
You love me too much.

1947
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:57,710
你还真相信我就是张麻子？
You still think I'm "Pocky" Zhang?

1948
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:01,030
你要不是张麻子 这山上可就有真麻子
If not, the real one must be somewhere around.

1949
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:03,070
张麻子一来 你我可就没命了
We're doomed if we run into him!

1950
01:38:03,960 --> 01:38:08,270
张麻子卜二
Speak of the devil!

1951
01:38:14,040 --> 01:38:15,590
告诉弟兄们 散开
Tell our men to hold their fire!

1952
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:17,710
别开枪 往山顶上跑

1961

01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:01,660
「不是十个 是十一个」

1963
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,990
「没事 你四 我七」
"No sweat, let's share them!"

1964
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:15,230
「落停」
"Done!"

1965
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,870
老三来信 西边搞定
Message from Three. West is secured.

1966
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,900

「我被包围了」

1973
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,670
「听我口令 甩斗笠」
"Throw the hats on my signal!"

1974
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:54,910
「东边归我 西边归你」

上东边
Let's move.

01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:05,830

没死！要说什么？我帮你吹

你带我走吧！
Can you lead the way?

不是嘴坏了吗？
You've only blown up your cheeks.

2002
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:39,110
嘴坏了用脚跑啊！
Your legs are fine.

2003

「大哥死了 大哥死了」
"Chief is dead! Chief is dead!"

2004
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:48,310
大哥死了？
The Chief is dead?

01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,150
他们说你死了！
They said you're dead.

2011
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:05,150
放他妈的屁！我这不还活着吗？
Bullshit! Am I not alive?

2012
01:42:05,560 --> 01:42:07,790
「大哥没死」
"Chief is alive and well!"

2013
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:10,150
放他妈的屁怎么没吹啊？
Why missed out signalling "bullshit"?

2014
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:11,950
「放你妈的屁」
"You're full of shit!"

2015
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:13,150
听见没
Hear that?

2016
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:15,910
骂咱们放你娘的屁呢！
He said we're full of shit.

2017
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,110
等会儿
Wait.

2018
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,100
假麻子抓到了
They caught the fake!

2019
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,580
你是张麻子？
You're "Pocky" Zhang?

2020
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:28,220
你脸上怎么没有麻子呢？
Where are your pockmarks?

2021
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:29,510
这事谁问谁死！
No one asking that question has survived.

2022
01:42:29,680 --> 01:42:30,950
明白了！不问了
Oops! I take it back.

2023
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:33,830
我这儿有一宝贝
I've got something special.

2024
01:42:34,160 --> 01:42:35,070
送给你了
You can have them,

2025
01:42:35,240 --> 01:42:36,670
能换我一条命吧？
in exchange for my life.

2026
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:41,190
那…那两个人呢？
What happened to them?

2027
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:43,150
说实话能换一条命吧
If I tell you, will you spare me?

2028
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:43,750
快说！
Speak!

2029
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:46,110
大个的被我给锯了 比矮个的还矮
I sawed the legs off the tall one.

2030
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:47,110
矮的呢？
And the short one?

2031
01:42:47,280 --> 01:42:48,190
当场就被吓死了
She died of fright at the sight!

2032
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,190
师爷！
Counselor.

2033
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:53,430
师爷！师爷！
Counselor...

2034
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:54,550
谁让你冒充我的？
Who's behind this scam?

2035
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,830
黄老爷
Master Huang.

2036
01:42:56,680 --> 01:42:57,740
麻子哪儿来的？
Nice pockmarks!

2037
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:58,590
他烫的
He burnt them.

2038
01:42:58,760 --> 01:42:59,740
劫了几任县官？
How many governors have you robbed?

2039
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:01,190
说出来能换条命吗？
Will you spare me?

2040
01:43:01,360 --> 01:43:01,950
快说！
Speak!

2041
01:43:02,120 --> 01:43:04,790
五回！五个县长全被我给干掉了
I've killed five governors,

2042
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,230
钱我跟黄老爷给分了
and shared the loot with Master Huang.

2043
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,430
那是什么？
What's that?

2044
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:09,510
万民伞！那五个被我干掉的县长留下的
A governor's silver umbrella.

2045
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:10,870
全都给你！
Take it!

2046
01:43:11,200 --> 01:43:12,990
-山西往哪边走啊？     -我还有四把呢
- Which way to Shanxi? - I have four more.

2047
01:43:13,160 --> 01:43:14,380
我知道
I know the way.

2048
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:15,710
说出来能换条人命吧？
Will you spare me if I tell you?

2049
01:43:15,880 --> 01:43:16,860
快他妈说！
Goddamned it! Speak!

2050
01:43:17,040 --> 01:43:18,750
往东！往东！
To the east, to the east!

2051
01:43:19,600 --> 01:43:22,630
哎呀！不能往东！千万不能往东！
Come back! You mustn't go that way!

2052
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,870
山西确实是在东边
But Shanxi really is to our east.

2053
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,350
东边…
East...

2054
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:47,070
你到底是不是张麻子？
Are you really "Pocky" Zhang?

2055
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,110
我是
Yes, I am.

2056
01:43:48,280 --> 01:43:50,910
我可是快要死的人了
I am about to kick the bucket,

2057
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:53,350
别骗我
don't lie to me.

2058
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,110
放心
Don't worry.

2059
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,430
我就是张麻子
I really am "Pocky" Zhang.

2060
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:00,700
麻子
Pocky!

2061
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,910
屁股…
My ass...

2062
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:05,710
屁股疼
it hurts.

2063
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,300
师爷
Counselor.

2064
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:11,550
屁股在树上呢
Your ass is on that tree.

2065
01:44:12,240 --> 01:44:13,590
不疼了
You can't feel it.

2066
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:21,630
我树上的屁股的口袋里
On my ass over there,

2067
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:23,990
有五张委任状
I have another five warrants.

2068
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,270
都给你
Take them.

2069
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:31,230
听我的 千万别回鹅城
Promise never to return to Goose Town.

2070
01:44:31,720 --> 01:44:36,350
你呀 弄不过黄四郎
You can't beat Huang.

2071
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:39,750
带上银子 走吧
Take the money and run.

2072
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:42,500
你放心 我不回鹅城
Don't worry, I won't go back.

2073
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:48,550
其实 我还有两档子事儿骗过你
I lied about two other things.

2074
01:44:49,240 --> 01:44:50,590
骗了就骗了吧
No big deal.

2075
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:52,270
不行
No.

2076
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:56,950
我死之前 我必须告诉你
I must confess before I die.

2077
01:44:57,120 --> 01:44:59,350
你说 头一档子
What was the first lie, then?

2078
01:44:59,720 --> 01:45:03,990
我…我能说这第二档子事儿吗？
Can I confess my second lie first?

2079
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,300
好
Yes.

2080
01:45:05,560 --> 01:45:09,310
那谁…你还记得吗？
Do you still remember...

2081
01:45:51,880 --> 01:45:54,990
我弄不清楚你到底是老汤
I can't quite figure you out.

2082
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:57,310
还是马邦德？
Counselor Tang or Governor Ma?

2083
01:45:58,240 --> 01:46:00,230
但是你没了
Now that you're gone,

2084
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,350
张麻子也没了
"Pocky" Zhang, too, is no more.

2085
01:46:03,680 --> 01:46:07,630
真的也没了 假的也没了
Fact or fiction no longer matter now.

2086
01:46:08,840 --> 01:46:14,750
兄弟 我要帮你把这个县长当下去
For you, I'll go back and finish this war!

2087
01:46:16,040 --> 01:46:17,390
弟兄们
Brothers!

2088
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:19,350
回鹅城！
March on Goose Town!

2089
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,430
这个张麻子
This "Pocky" Zhang

2090
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,910
杀了假麻子
has killed his imposter.

2091
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:32,030
得了钱 不逃命
But instead of fleeing with the money,

2092
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:35,080
莫非要跟我鱼死网破？
he wants a showdown with me.

2093
01:46:35,240 --> 01:46:37,070
那就请官兵来剿匪！
Let's get reinforcement.

2094
01:46:37,240 --> 01:46:38,950
我早就派胡百过去了
I've sent Hu Bai to fetch troops.

2095
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:42,660
三天之后郭旅长的骑兵就到了
Cavalry will arrive in 3 days.

2096
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,750
县长要斩黄四郎！
Governor swears to behead Huang,

2097
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:54,220
谁人不想斩黄郎！
public enemy number one.

2098
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,430
拐卖壮丁贩烟土！
Trades in opium and human misery,

2099
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,590
杀了五任好县长！
Huang has killed five governors.

2100
01:47:09,120 --> 01:47:11,550
一成白银送你手！
The money that's been given out,

2101
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,630
九成真金黄家藏！
is but one-tenth of his hoard!

2102
01:47:21,200 --> 01:47:23,500
邦德发誓三天内！
In memory of his dead comrades,

2103
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,750
除暴安良祭老汤！
Ma will parade Huang's head in 3 days!

2104
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,710
白花花的银子都散给了穷人
He gave away all his money to the poor.

2105
01:47:39,880 --> 01:47:41,070
作孽！
Disgraceful!

2106
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,660
老爷 散不了吧！
The money is not being taken!

2107
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:49,750
你瞧 除了鹅 没有活物敢过去
No one dare to go near except those geese!

2108
01:47:59,280 --> 01:47:59,790
我去找花姐
I'll go and find Flora!

2109
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:01,950
你把花姐和替身都给我找回来
Bring her and Huang's double back.

2110
01:48:02,120 --> 01:48:03,590
三天之内必须找回来！
We only have three days.

2111
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:05,910
这个张麻子到底要干嘛呢？
What is on his mind?

2112
01:48:06,040 --> 01:48:07,550
他们干什么都是白干！
They're a bunch of clowns!

2113
01:48:07,720 --> 01:48:09,710
咱们一个字 斩！
We simply want them...dead!

2114
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:11,350
可他说过
He has sworn publicly,

2115
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:14,270
三天之后斩我人头
to behead me in 3 days.

2116
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:17,710
荆轲当年还说要斩秦始皇呢
Some said I'd win the lottery too!

2117
01:48:22,160 --> 01:48:23,870
大哥 三天
Can the four of us

2118
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:26,190
就我们四个要杀黄四郎？
kill Huang in three days?

2119
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:27,270
对
Yes.

2120
01:48:27,440 --> 01:48:28,500
还把话说出去了
We've been telling everyone that.

2121
01:48:28,680 --> 01:48:31,140
话不说出去 事就办不成
We can't back out now!

2122
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:32,510
胜算有几成啊？
What are our chances?

2123
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,750
「三成」
"30%"

2124
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:36,430
三成不是玩命吗？
30%? Are we out of our mind?

2125
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:39,710
我去睡会儿啊 你们在这盯着
Time for a nap. Keep watch.

2126
01:48:53,720 --> 01:48:54,190
南风
Queen!

2127
01:48:54,360 --> 01:48:54,950
北风
Knave!

2128
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,430
胡啦
Bingo!

2129
01:48:57,720 --> 01:48:58,780
大哥 银子都没了！
Chief, the money is gone.

2130
01:48:58,960 --> 01:48:59,590
我看见了
I could see that.

2131
01:48:59,760 --> 01:49:00,740
现在有四成了吧
We must have a 40% chance now!

2132
01:49:00,920 --> 01:49:01,590
五成？
50%?

2133
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:02,740
七成？
70%?

2134
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,190
不能吧
Surely not!

2135
01:49:04,360 --> 01:49:06,630
老百姓把钱都拿回家了 还三成啊？
Still only 30% after they took the money?

2136
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:08,230
银子要是这么被拿走了
If things are that simple,

2137
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:09,750
那钱就白发了
our efforts will be in vain.

2138
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:11,910
出车！
Send the carriages!

2139
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,710
我要你看一看 什么叫做草船借箭
I'll show you how to
"borrow arrows with a straw boat"!

2140
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:22,790
老爷 咱们放的是马 不是船
But we just sent horses, not straw boats.

2141
01:49:23,880 --> 01:49:24,630
你这个傻瓜
Idiot!

2142
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:27,790
这叫比喻！比喻！…
It's only a metaphor!

2143
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,310
不就是赤壁嘛！
You're almost metaphysical!

2144
01:49:51,320 --> 01:49:52,790
银子都被黄四郎收走了
Huang has taken all the silvers.

2145
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,510
胜算都不到一成了
We've no chance of winning.

2146
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,870
「六成」
"60%"

2147
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:00,350
黄四郎都没出面啊
Huang didn't even have to show up,

2148
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:02,350
老百姓把所有钱都交出去了
everyone has surrendered their money.

2149
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:03,590
哪来六啊？
How can it be 60%?

2150
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:04,820
说得对！
Well said!

2151
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:05,670
为什么？
So why 60%?

2152
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:06,750
怕啊！
It's because of fear.

2153
01:50:06,920 --> 01:50:08,270
怕里边有什么？
What lies beneath fear?

2154
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,150
有怒！
Rage!

2155
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:13,510
我一定把他们心里的怒给勾出来
We need to bring forth their rage!

2156
01:50:22,800 --> 01:50:24,190
满街枪弹在你手！
As guns and ammos wait for you,

2157
01:50:25,080 --> 01:50:27,150
十成白银在碉楼！
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

2158
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:29,870
满街枪弹在你手！
As guns and ammos wait for you,

2159
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,910
十成白银在碉楼！
Huang hoards fortune in his citadel.

2160
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,990
屡败还屡战！
Never-say-die!

2161
01:51:01,200 --> 01:51:01,710
我喜欢！
I like that!

2162
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:04,710
那是枪啊！要不 放马？
Those are guns! Send carriages?

2163
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:09,390
拿银子 是贪！拿枪 是反
Money incites greed. But guns are seditious!

2164
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,270
他们没这个胆！
They wouldn't dare.

2165
01:51:12,720 --> 01:51:15,150
银子被收走了 枪也没人拿
The money's gone, but the guns remain!

2166
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:16,710
怎么办 大哥？
What do we do now?

2167
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:18,150
胜算几成？
What are our chances?

2168
01:51:18,720 --> 01:51:20,230
「七成」
"70%"

2169
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:23,910
黄四郎把所有的钱都给收了
Huang has taken all the money.

2170
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:25,190
我们发的枪也没人拿
But no one takes our guns.

2171
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:26,580
哪来的七成啊？
How come it's 70%?

2172
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:29,550
黄四郎要是不收银子 我发枪干什么？
If he hadn't taken the money,
I wouldn't have to distribute the guns!

2173
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:32,670
黄四郎不收银子 我发枪干什么？
...wouldn't have distributed the guns!

收枪
Collect the guns.

2181
01:52:13,760 --> 01:52:14,710

枪响了
Shots were fired!

2184

怒了 全都怒了！
They're all raging mad!

2186
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:35,030
他妈的的刁民 敢杀我的马？
How dare they shot my horse?

2187
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:05,870

跟我们来的只有它们！
Only they have come this far with us!

2203
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:36,190
高兴早了 没人帮咱们！
We're on our own!

2204
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:38,500
明白了！
I see.

2205
01:54:38,680 --> 01:54:40,270
谁赢 他们帮谁！
They will only side with the victors.

2206
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:43,230
黄四郎四百人 我们四个人 怎么赢啊？
We can't overcome Huang's 400 men!

2207
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:44,790
打！打就能赢！
Shoot! We can win!

2208
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,230
打哪儿？这只有铁门
What's our target? There's only a gate.

2209
01:54:46,440 --> 01:54:47,710
就打铁门！
Let's blast the gate, then.

2210
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:55,070
他们鼓动了多少人？
How many people have they brought?

2211
01:54:55,200 --> 01:54:56,070
就他们四个
Just the four of them.

2212
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:56,790
不可能吧！
You're kidding!

01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,430
三哥不回来可就…
If Three doesn't return in time...

2219
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,150
我知道你是怎么想的
I know what's on your mind.

2220
01:55:29,400 --> 01:55:30,510
知道惊叹号吧
Can you draw an exclamation mark?

2221
01:55:31,600 --> 01:55:33,350
在门上打出个惊叹号来
Let's do one on the gate!

2222
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:34,620
好嘞
Right on.

2223
01:55:37,080 --> 01:55:39,790
这像惊叹号吗？那点呢？
What's that? Where's the dot?

2224
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,190
歪了
You missed!

2225
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:43,750
躲开
Move over.

2226
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:48,030
勾？
A hook stroke?

2227
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:50,030
再看
Look again!

2228
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:52,580
问号
A question mark!

2229
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:56,150
小子 你只要打得准
If you can shoot straight,

2230
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:57,590
什么时候都能跑！
you'll have nothing to worry!

2231
01:55:58,240 --> 01:55:58,990
把你们的子弹
Empty your guns

2232
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:00,590
从那问号的点里打过去
at the question mark!

2233
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,030
好啦！快！
Okay!

2234
01:56:04,160 --> 01:56:05,950
大哥…！

都在那
They're here.

2241
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:17,940
你可回来了！
You're back, at last.

2242
01:56:18,120 --> 01:56:20,270
我不是他 我只是个唱戏的！
I'm not Huang! I'm just an actor!

2243
01:56:20,440 --> 01:56:21,230
怎么回事？
What happened?

2244
01:56:21,400 --> 01:56:23,430
他跑我就追 他跑我就追
He ran away and I chased after him.

2245
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:24,390
就越跑越远了！
We ran a long way!

2246
01:56:24,600 --> 01:56:25,510
他跑我就堵
I caught up with them.

2247
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:27,870
他跑我就堵 就给堵回来了！
He finally succumbed after I'd him cornered.

2248
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:30,310
就这么简单？
That was it?

2249
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:31,830
对 就这么简单
Yes, that simple.

2250

正被当成替身 挨揍呢
They took him for his double.

2285
01:59:21,080 --> 01:59:22,990
黄四郎的威风是被你砍了
You've ended Huang's reign.

2286
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:25,350
他这肉身怎么办啊？

2287
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:26,430
留不留啊？
Let him go?

2288
01:59:26,640 --> 01:59:29,630

黄四郎是死了
Huang has died!

2292
01:59:33,840 --> 01:59:35,670
但死得太便宜了
But he has got off lightly!

2293
01:59:35,880 --> 01:59:37,070
咔嚓呀
Swoosh!

2294

一刀给砍了！
by that stupid Governor!

2296
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:44,790
何止是愚蠢 简直就是愚蠢
That was stupid! That was ignorant!

2297
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:45,870
这公平吗？
That's not justice!

2298
01:59:46,040 --> 01:59:46,870
不公平！
No! It's not!

2299

我不是他
I am not him.

我知道你是替身
I know you're his double.

2303
01:59:51,640 --> 01:59:53,350
替他享福！替他作恶！
But you shared his life and committed his crimes.

2304
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:56,190
你就应该替他 把他没受过的罪
So you should be punished

2305
01:59:56,360 --> 01:59:57,270
给我受够了！
as if you were him!

又想挨板子了是吧？
Want your ass kicked again?

2316

Just yell if you need me.

2322
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:27,150
兄弟立马出现
Always at your service, sir.

2323
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:30,150
告辞！告辞！走！
Goodbye, sir. Beat it!

2324
02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:43,950
下一步有什么打算？
What's next for you?

2325
02:00:44,120 --> 02:00:46,550
留在鹅城代替我？
Take my place here?

2326
02:00:48,920 --> 02:00:50,140
我不是家禽
I'm not a caged bird.

2327
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:52,710
你是野兽
You're a predator.

2328
02:00:58,960 --> 02:01:02,350
进城那天 如果我亲自去接你
The day of your inauguration,

2329
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:05,870
不是叫胡万过去给你捣乱
had I greeted you in person,

2330
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:08,910
结果会不会不一样？
would things have turned out differently?

2331
02:01:09,160 --> 02:01:11,790
那帽子挺好 我喜欢
It was a nice hat. I liked it.

2332
02:01:12,040 --> 02:01:15,110
那不是最好的 我家里还有更好的
I have nicer ones at home.

2333
02:01:16,160 --> 02:01:17,270
转头送给你
I can give them to you.

2334
02:01:20,400 --> 02:01:22,150
一下子弄成了这样
Everything's gone in a flash.

2335
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:25,990
你让我输得很惨啊！
You've totally wiped me out.

2336
02:01:27,800 --> 02:01:29,590
惨吗？黄老爷
It's not that bad.

2337
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:31,310
你现在还抽着烟
You're still having a smoke,

2338
02:01:31,880 --> 02:01:33,430
还说着话
still chit-chatting.

2339
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:39,630
可是六子 老二 师爷、夫人
But Six, Two, Counselor and his wife...

2340
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:42,110
我听不到他们的声音了
I can no longer hear their voice.

2341
02:01:42,440 --> 02:01:45,550
而且永远听不到了
Never ever again.

2342
02:01:47,320 --> 02:01:48,950
你们四个人
Their four lives,

2343
02:01:49,800 --> 02:01:51,830
换我五代家业
in exchange for my heirloom,

2344
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,430
不合算吗？
isn't that enough?

2345
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:55,590
怎么算帐那是你的事
That's none of my business.

2346
02:01:55,920 --> 02:01:56,900
对我来说…
To me,

2347
02:01:57,440 --> 02:01:59,870
钱是钱 人是人
they are separate issues.

2348
02:02:00,280 --> 02:02:02,630
钱归了你 我认了
You could have kept the money.

2349
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,910
为什么要散给他们？
But why did you give it away?

2350
02:02:07,680 --> 02:02:10,190
黄老爷 我问你个问题
Master Huang, let me ask you a question.

2351
02:02:10,520 --> 02:02:11,390
说
Shoot!

2352
02:02:12,120 --> 02:02:14,190
你说是钱对我重要
Which is more important to me?

2353
02:02:14,400 --> 02:02:15,670
还是你对我重要？
You or your fortune?

2354
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:17,980
我
Me.

2355
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:20,820
再想想
Think again.

2356
02:02:23,880 --> 02:02:25,270
不会是钱吧？
Can it be the money?

2357
02:02:26,360 --> 02:02:27,710
再想想
Think again.

2358
02:02:32,600 --> 02:02:33,950
还是我重要
I still think it's me.

2359
02:02:34,120 --> 02:02:37,270
你和钱对我都不重要
Neither matters to me.

2360
02:02:39,040 --> 02:02:40,180
那谁重要？
Then what is?

2361
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:47,310
没有你 对我很重要
To rid of you is more important.

2362
02:02:57,880 --> 02:02:59,270
你不是找火柴吧？
Looking for a light?

2363
02:02:59,680 --> 02:03:00,350
不是
No.

2364
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:02,030
那…
You must be...

2365
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:04,310
你是找这个
Iooking for this.

2366
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:13,590
你是个体面人
You're a man of honour.

2367
02:03:21,200 --> 02:03:22,420
只有一颗子弹
There's only one bullet left.

2368
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:25,230
够
That's enough.

2369
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:27,110
等等
Wait.

2370
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:28,910
有话要我带给老汤？
Any message for Tang?

2371
02:03:29,080 --> 02:03:30,870
对了 告诉他…
Right, tell him...

2372
02:03:32,160 --> 02:03:33,510
我对不起他
I owe him an apology.

2373
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:35,110
我骗了他
I lied to him.

2374
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:37,750
你骗了他什么？
What was your lie?

2375
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,300
我跟他说不回鹅城了
I said I wouldn't come back.

2376
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:41,710
可是我回来了
But here I am.

2377
02:03:42,240 --> 02:03:43,220
你…
You...

2378
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:44,950
你应该说到做到
You should have kept your promise.

2379
02:03:45,120 --> 02:03:46,950
是 我对不起他
Yes, I let him down.

2380
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:50,150
可是我对你
But when it comes to you,

2381
02:03:50,920 --> 02:03:52,630
就要说到做到
I'll definitely keep my words.

2382
02:03:57,520 --> 02:03:58,710
明白
Understood.

2383
02:04:00,160 --> 02:04:01,750
明白！
Understood...

2384
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:12,230
县长 县长…
Governor...

2385
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,310
这两把椅子归我了
These chairs are mine.

2386
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:22,950
大哥…
Chief...

2387
02:04:26,640 --> 02:04:27,670
别慌
Easy...

2388
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:28,750
我能问你个问题吗？
Can I ask you a question?

2389
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:29,870
说
Sure.

2390
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,190
你喜欢花姐对吗？
You fancy Flora, right?

2391
02:04:34,120 --> 02:04:35,670
县长 县长
Governor,

2392
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:37,710
我觉得我可以出现了
may I interrupt?

2393
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,430
刚才我都听见了
I overheard everything.

2394
02:04:39,720 --> 02:04:41,670
他可不是个体面的人
Huang is not an honourable man.

2395
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,550
我给了他一把手枪
I gave him a pistol.

2396
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:46,270
他要是体面 你就让他体面
He can take his own life.

2397
02:04:46,640 --> 02:04:49,100
他要是不体面 你就帮他体面
If he doesn't, lend him a hand.

2398
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,230
我明白！
Understood.

2399
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:51,990
我有九种办法弄死他！
I have 9 ways to skin this cat!

2400
02:04:52,160 --> 02:04:53,350
九种！
Nine ways!

2401
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:56,230
听我的雷声！
You'll hear my roar!

2402
02:04:57,120 --> 02:04:59,030
是有这么回事 怎么了？
Maybe just a little. Why?

2403
02:05:03,720 --> 02:05:05,110
千万别说是我说的
Don't say I tipped you off.

2404
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:12,070
大哥 我们准备去上海了
Chief, we're off to Shanghai.

2405
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:13,630
不跟我回山里了？
Not riding back with me?

2406
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:14,860
还想回山里啊？
Still want to resume banditry?

2407
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,590
您这腿脚都不利落了
You're too old for this.

2408
02:05:17,240 --> 02:05:19,670
怎么也不跟我打个招呼
You should've given me a heads-up.

2409
02:05:20,160 --> 02:05:21,870
这不正要跟您打招呼了嘛
That's what we're doing!

2410
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:25,270
你不是要跟我当麻匪 到处发钱吗？
Didn't you want to be one of us?

2411
02:05:25,440 --> 02:05:27,110
今天不是把钱都发光了吗？
I just helped to dish out the money.

2412
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:28,830
还有比今天更过瘾的？
I've never had a more satisfying day!

2413
02:05:29,080 --> 02:05:30,550
你看我都穿上这身了！
I'm even dressed for the part!

2414
02:05:31,720 --> 02:05:32,830
这么说…
So...

2415
02:05:34,040 --> 02:05:34,910
你改主意了？
you've changed your mind?

2416
02:05:35,080 --> 02:05:36,510
那还用说吗
That goes without saying!

2417
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:40,950
老三 你有什么打算？
What's your plan, Three?

2418
02:05:41,960 --> 02:05:43,710
我要替二哥娶她
I'm going to marry her, on behalf of Two.

2419
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:48,140
老二啊老二…
Two...

2420
02:05:48,920 --> 02:05:51,510
大哥 我是老三
Chief, I'm Three!

2421
02:05:54,560 --> 02:05:56,910
老三 你跟我在一起
Three, it no longer thrills you

2422
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,110
-不高兴吗？     -高兴
- to ride with me? - Yes!

2423
02:06:00,640 --> 02:06:01,750
就是…
But...

2424
02:06:02,600 --> 02:06:03,870
有点不轻松
it's been hard going lately.

2425
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:06,780
-你们俩呢？     -有点
- What about you? - We've had...

2426
02:06:06,960 --> 02:06:08,350
不轻松
better days.

2427
02:06:08,760 --> 02:06:09,590
老七呢？
Seven?

2428
02:06:14,080 --> 02:06:16,030
大哥…
Chief...

2429
02:06:17,560 --> 02:06:18,870
姑娘
Flora,

2430
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:21,350
你这么拿着枪
hold your guns like this,

2431
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:23,150
更好看
makes you look even cooler.

2432
02:06:28,760 --> 02:06:29,870
送你了
They're yours.

2433
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:34,110
大哥 那我们先走一步啊！
Chief, we've got to go.

2434
02:06:34,280 --> 02:06:34,830
走了 大哥
Goodbye, Chief.

2435
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:35,390

老六 老二 师爷 夫人
Six, Two, Counselor, Madam...

2445
02:07:23,680 --> 02:07:25,110
你们看到了吧
Did you see that?

2446
02:08:13,360 --> 02:08:15,820
老三 去上海还是浦东？
Three, Shanghai or Pudong?

2447
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:19,100
老三 去浦东还是上海？
Three, Pudong or Shanghai?

2448
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,390
