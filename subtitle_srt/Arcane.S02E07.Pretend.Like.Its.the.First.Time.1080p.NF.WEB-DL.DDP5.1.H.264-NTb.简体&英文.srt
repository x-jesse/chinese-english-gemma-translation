1
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,450
你真是没救了
You're beyond help.

2
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,290
别一惊一乍的 行吗
Whoa, relax, jumpy.

3
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,490
我有个办法让能量保持稳定
I've got a new idea...

4
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,160
这样主体框架就不会爆炸了

5
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,540
怎么还摔上东西了
Uh, did you just throw that?

6
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,790
别...别过来
Stay... Stay back.

7
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,200
你们叮铃咣啷的在这儿干什么呢
What in the seven sumps is all this racket?

8
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,910
喂 今天气儿又不太顺吗
Oi, one of those days, huh?

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,790
天才和疯子一线之隔
You know those ugly twins,

10
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,620
难免会有点小摩擦
genius and madness.

11
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:40,120
那能不能让疯子先出去一下啊
Maybe take the madness outside.

12
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,000
我这儿还得继续做生意呢
I still got a business to...

13
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:45,660
你这是又闹哪出啊
What's gotten into him?

14
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,200
{\an8}《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第七集

15
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,200
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

16
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,660
嘿 回回神儿
Hey, spaceboy,

17
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,040
别让我在这自言自语啊
I'm not talking to myself over here.

18
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,200
你到底是怎么回事
What is up with you? 

19
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,040
一整天都不在状态
You've been out of it all day.

20
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,830
我感觉一睁眼就来错了宇宙了
I feel like I woke up in the wrong universe.

21
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,080
我看你是熬夜熬的吧
This is what happens when you stay up all night.

22
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,660
神经元突触不听使唤了
Those synapses start firing around

23
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,080
就跟鼻涕虫喝醉酒一样
like drunk slugs.

24
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,410
我们还有大把时间为竞赛做准备呢
There's still plenty of time before the competition.

25
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,660
放心 全都能搞定的
Okay? We'll work out the kinks.

26
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,870
不是有我呢吗
I've got you.

27
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,000
什么风把底城的大人物给吹来了
Ah, if it isn't Zaun's royalty.

28
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,910
给大人请安
My liege.

29
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,910
快过来坐
Sit down.

30
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,040
嘿嘿 小不点 怎么还耷拉个脸呢
Hey, hey, little man. Trouble in paradise?

31
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,580
就是项目上遇到了点小磕绊
Just the usual project woes.

32
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,910
咱俩差不多
Tell me about it.

33
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,620
好不容易将裂沟废气变废为宝了
We finally got the hybrids to feed off the fissure gases,

34
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,950
可是转化率实在太低了 一直提高不了
but the conversion rate's way too low.

35
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,330
这样下去
They hardly grow.

36
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,410
还是没有办法实现全城空气的净化啊
They're nowhere near robust enough to purify all the air down here.

37
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,080
那得建成百上千个系统吧
Unless you plant a million of them.

38
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,540
那根本不可能
No way we're doing that.

39
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,950
土壤培育还有水渗透的方法 我们都试过了
And we've tried cultivating the soil, infusing the water.

40
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,370
全都不行
No luck.

41
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,160
我先出去一下
I'll be right back.

42
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,870
得 去吧 不撞南墙不回头啊
Oh, no. Go. Save him from himself.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,500
没有她 你可怎么办啊
Where would you be without her?

44
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,950
嗨 格...
Hey, Gert.

45
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,870
不行
No. 

46
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,080
勇敢点
Oh, come on.

47
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,740
- 嗨 格尔... - 嘿 格尔特
- Hey... - Hey, Gert.

48
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,660
什么时候能再看一次 炼金姐妹的表演啊
Do the Chem Sisters have another show coming up?

49
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,990
麦罗可是被迷得团团转
Mylo here is a big fan.

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,410
他现在根本停不下来
Like, huge.

51
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,120
是吗
Cool.

52
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:22,870
对了
Uh, yeah, 

53
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,580
老大安排我们去给你俩的那个
the old man's gonna let us play the party the night before

54
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,290
创新者竞赛的赛前派对助兴
that Innovators Competition you all are gunning for.

55
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,790
没有你 他们可怎么办呀
What would they do without you?

56
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,330
多少会有点手足无措吧
There would probably be some arm-flailing.

57
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,290
其实 开了这酒馆之后 我学会了一件事
You know, one thing I learned as a bartender:

58
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,870
忙着把每位客人照顾好的同时
As good as it feels to pour everyone's drink,

59
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,290
给自己也应该倒上一杯
you need to fill your own cup 

60
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,660
犒劳犒劳自己
every now and again.

61
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,500
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

62
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,290
你觉得我这是在耽误自己
You think I'm holding myself back.

63
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:09,500
我觉着 你的聪明才干 泡在这酒馆可惜了
I think you're too smart to spend your life in a bar.

64
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,000
嗨 教授
Hey, professor.

65
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,500
- 教授  - 我是错过思想碰撞的盛会了吗
- Professor? - Am I late for a gathering of the minds?

66
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:47,410
发现自己被推入平行时空
One can't shout from the rooftops

67
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,910
兴奋地冲上屋顶大喊大叫之后
about being thrust into parallel dimensions

68
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,620
免不了会感到有些不适
without awkward consequences.

69
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,410
异常点
It seems 

70
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:58,410
当它将我们从固有认知中的现实 抽离的那一刻
the anomaly which dislodged us from our proverbial reality

71
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,250
也让我们散落到了不同的时间里
also scattered us across time.

72
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,080
我还以为我的精神出问题了
Man, I thought I was going crazy.

73
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,330
你来这里多久了
How long have you been here?

74
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,660
来了1128天6个小时零...20分钟了
One thousand, one hundred twenty-eight days, six hours, and twenty minutes.

75
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,910
大差不差的
Give or take.

76
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,540
所以你待了这么久 就是为了等我
So you've just been waiting for me all this time?

77
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,580
可以这么说 或者...
Precisely. Or 

78
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,040
也可以不这么说
rather, imprecisely.

79
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,200
即便我寿命比一般人长
I grew skeptical you'd arrive,

80
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,740
但我也不敢确定能不能真的等到你
even during my unusually long lifetime.

81
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,830
那杰斯呢 他也来了吗
What about Jayce? Is he here?

82
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,990
我猜他恐怕是去了别的时空了
I fear he may have wound up elsewhere.

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,950
异常点在他身上产生的效果不一样
The anomaly behaved differently around him.

84
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,410
你应该有办法能把我们带回去的吧
Tell me you figured out a way to get us home.

85
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:44,290
你这话倒是把我难倒了
That is a veritable conundrum.

86
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,080
要是这里发明不出海克斯科技的话
I'm afraid Hextech was never invented here.

87
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,490
那么也自然就造不出 海克斯飞门这种神奇的东西了
And without a creation so prodigious as the Hexgates...

88
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,370
也没有异常点了
No anomaly.

89
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,620
哎呀 也没那么糟糕
Oh, it isn't all bad.

90
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,740
我在这个世界就干了不少很棒的事
I've been able to accomplish wonderful things in this world.

91
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,450
给自己点时间
Give it time to settle.

92
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,830
你也一定会越来越适应这里的
This place will grow on you. You'll see.

93
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,700
适应这里
Grow on me?

94
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,580
原来的那个世界还有人需要我
I have people back home who need me.

95
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,120
我们不属于这里
We don't belong here.

96
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,540
可我们暂时还回不去
And yet we can't leave.

97
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,830
算了 我自己想办法回去 你爱帮不帮
I'm gonna find a way back, with or without you.

98
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,000
我准备一会儿去看看蔚
I was gonna go see Vi.

99
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,790
蔚
Vi?

100
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,910
要不一起去
You wanna come?

101
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,870
我们究竟做了什么
What have we done?

102
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,750
有人吗
Hello?

103
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,370
有没有人啊
Is anyone out there?

104
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,660
谁

105
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,750
是什么人
Who's there?

106
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,330
是你
You.

107
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,790
是你带我来的吗
Did you bring me here?

108
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:46,910
这是什么地方
Where are we?

109
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,500
等等
Wait!

110
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,450
不
No.

111
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,540
怎么可能
It can't be.

112
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,580
哪来这么多问题 艾克
What's with the third degree, Ekko?

113
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,660
弄得跟这不是你的项目似的
We've been working on this for months.

114
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,080
你就说吧
Humor me.

115
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,740
当初是你信誓旦旦地说
You had one of your funky dreams

116
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,990
你那个能量储存装置的离谱设想
about an energy-storage device 

117
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,950
一定能赢得竞赛 所以...
that you swore would win the competition. So 

118
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:46,910
你才来找我帮忙的
you came to me for help.

119
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,240
我找你帮忙
I came to you?

120
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:51,250
因为你怕你自己搞不定啊
You weren't gonna figure it out yourself.

121
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,120
项目“零” 零损耗化学能量单元
"Zero-loss chemical energy cell."

122
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,200
那这个设想...
And this invention.

123
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,660
你没有想过把它用到其他地方吗
You don't have some alternative purpose for it?

124
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,910
这事儿问你自己才对吧
You're the big idea guy.

125
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:05,250
抱歉 姐姐
Sorry, sis.

126
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,700
有个人正在为他的项目头疼
Someone's wigging out over his project 

127
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,290
而且又在打退堂鼓
and having an identity crisis again.

128
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,950
名字不提了
No names.

129
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,120
范德尔说我没有 把自己的潜力用对地方
I got the "not living up to my potential" speech from Vander again.

130
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,790
他一说这话 我就总想到你
Reminds me of you.

131
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
她死了
She's dead?

132
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,410
怎么死的
How?

133
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,250
别开这种玩笑 艾克
That's not funny, Ekko.

134
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,290
我真的不该来这儿的
It was a mistake to come here.

135
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,910
你说这话什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

136
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,410
你自己心里有不痛快
Just 'cause you're having a bad day, 

137
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,950
也别拿我撒气
don't take it out on me.

138
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,700
是因为你吗
Was it you?

139
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,240
是你给我们递的信
You gave us the tip.

140
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,830
我们去干了那一票 都是因为你
We went on that job because of you.

141
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,830
那一票 怪不得这里没有海克斯科技
The job. That's why there's no Hextech here.

142
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,240
你还是走吧 快走
You should leave.

143
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,000
别让我干出后悔的事
Go. Before I do something I regret.

144
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:00,040
说实话 我也没想留下
Believe me, I'm working on it.

145
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,410
等等我

146
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,450
快来 快来这边
Come on. I saw it over here.

147
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,250
你要喝茶吗 先生
Care for a cup of tea, sir?

148
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:58,700
得了
Come on.

149
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,870
(理发店)

150
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,500
看轮盘转动 将停留何方

151
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,750
沉浸喧嚣 舞一曲何妨

152
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:27,240
战火已悄然熄灭 音乐奏响

153
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:32,450
朋友们啊 走吧

154
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,660
让一切随风

155
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,790
与至亲分享你的人生见闻

156
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,910
若你能 爱上这旅程 莫问终点

157
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,910
出发

158
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:05,580
我将那沙漏翻转 默数十声

159
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,410
不需要道别

160
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,910
蔚奥莱 不要 求你不要死
Violet, don't! Ple--

161
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:12,200
不要
Please, no...

162
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,700
才刚启程

163
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,950
朋友走吧

164
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,910
求你了

165
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,000
别太在意遗憾 这才是人生

166
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,450
若尘埃落定 就无问西东

167
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:09,790
就让清风拂过 燃起篝火

168
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:14,790
齿轮转动 朋友

169
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,000
齿轮转动 朋友

170
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,750
让它转动

171
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,160
谢谢大家
Thank you very much.

172
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,540
你觉得靠这些就能让异常点重现了
You think you can recreate the anomaly with these?

173
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,080
理论上行
That's the theory.

174
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,330
想法倒是不错
Inconceivable.

175
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:41,910
你愿意帮我吗
So you'll help me?

176
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,790
我只是说想法不错
I meant that quite literally.

177
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,700
可没说真的可以去这么干
I don't believe this can be done.

178
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:50,740
贸然使用奥术 是不会有好下场的 小伙子
Tampering with the Arcane never ends well, lad.

179
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,790
风险实在太大了
The risk is far too great.

180
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,080
你说过我是你的学生
You said I was your pupil.

181
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,290
我需要你的指导
I need a professor.

182
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,370
要能成为搭档 就更好了
Better yet, a partner.

183
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,370
我的机械祖师爷
Oh, blast nozzles.

184
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,700
我果然是不忍心拒绝青年才俊啊
How could I forsake a brilliant lad in need?

185
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,660
老毛病了
Again.

186
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,410
我就该承受这些吗
I never asked for this.

187
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:42,290
这个研究是我的一切 是我的毕生心血
That research is everything. My whole life.

188
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,790
他曾是我的导师 我却背弃了他
He was my mentor, Mel. And I betrayed him.

189
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,410
你们必须摧毁它
You must destroy it.

190
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:59,410
它腐蚀了人心 耗尽了资源
It corrupts. Consumes.

191
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,580
我本来是想创造魔法的
I was trying to create magic.

192
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,410
- 皮尔特沃夫的未来 - 是你的时代了 杰斯
- Piltover... - It's your time now, Jayce.

193
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,490
也许是时候
Perhaps it's time.

194
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,830
不 不
No, no.

195
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,580
开启魔法的纪元了
For the era of magic.

196
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,160
无数城邦的毁灭 都来自一颗邪恶的种子
I've seen nations destroyed...

197
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,700
- 别这样 - 而这个就跟那些一样
- Please. - ...exactly like this.

198
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,950
小心脚下
Watch your step.

199
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,950
我们快到了
We're almost there.

200
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,490
艾克 我不知道你想干什么
I don't know what this is all about,

201
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,330
如果你是要道歉的话
but if you're trying to apologize, 

202
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,620
把我拽到一个...
dragging me through the...

203
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,330
这都是

204
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,160
你自己画的
You painted this?

205
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,910
我做了一个梦
I had this dream...

206
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,370
梦里的一切都是相反的
where things went another way.

207
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,540
她看起来挺不好惹的
She looks so badass.

208
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,950
何止是不好惹
You don't know the half of it.

209
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,040
这家伙在底城可是打遍天下无敌手
She was the toughest person in all of Zaun.

210
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,410
无所畏惧
Nothing scared her.

211
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,370
我姐才不是这样
No, not my sister.

212
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,450
她外表坚强 内心却很脆弱
Vi was strong because she was afraid.

213
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,950
她一直拼尽全力
Her fear of losing us is 

214
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:07,790
只是因为害怕失去我们
what made her fight so hard.

215
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,240
在我梦里 你也变了个样
You were different in my dream too. 

216
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,500
是吗 小子
Oh, yeah, buster?

217
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,370
在这儿等着我呢 是吧
Is that what this is about? 

218
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,950
想求我改变
You want me to change?

219
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:16,870
没有
No.

220
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,750
没有 只是
No, no, I just...

221
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,700
你不应该是那个
You aren't the kind of person 

222
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,500
那个去帮助别人实现梦想的人
who helps other people with their projects.

223
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,790
你的想法能改变这个世界
Your ideas change the world.

224
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,080
我一直都这么认为
I can't shake the feeling that 

225
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,250
那才是你该有的样子
that's who you're supposed to be.

226
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,200
现在挺好的 艾克
Things are good, Ekko.

227
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,500
我...我现在很开心
I like my life.

228
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:43,370
我不想为了追逐所谓的梦想去改变
I don't wanna lose what makes me "me"

229
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,290
去变成另一副模样
chasing some wild dream.

230
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,200
有时候 向前一步
Sometimes taking a leap 

231
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,950
往往意味着需要舍弃一些东西
forward means leaving a few things behind.

232
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:57,660
你有时候真是让人猜不透啊
You're a real mystery, aren't you, mister?

233
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,330
好了 别绕弯子了
All right, out with it.

234
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,700
到底想让我干嘛
What do you want from me?

235
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,160
这也太小了
It's so small.

236
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,120
天哪
Golly, 

237
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,620
竟然做到了
we've done it.

238
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,950
这才哪到哪啊
Halfway there.

239
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,500
所以这玩意儿有什么用
So, what does it do?

240
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:05,870
所以这玩意儿有什么用
So, what does it do?

241
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,700
你刚刚不是问过我了吗
You just asked me that.

242
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,370
我没问过
No, I didn't.

243
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,660
我现在没心情陪你玩游戏
I'm too tired for games.

244
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,410
我没问过
No, I didn't.

245
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,250
这是时间循环
It's a time loop.

246
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,500
时间循环
Huh? A time loop?

247
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:29,370
时间循环
- Huh? A time loop? - A time loop.

248
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,830
你刚才回到过去了吗
You're going back in time.

249
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,450
机械祖师爷啊 歪打正着还真就成了
Gadzooks. How did you stumble upon that?

250
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,870
我试了一下把杰斯的 加速符文反转过来操作
I was playing with inversions on Jayce's acceleration rune.

251
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,700
那你回去了多久
How far did you go?

252
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,160
不知道 一秒钟
I don't know. A second?

253
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,740
试试能不能再久一点
Try going back further.

254
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,410
嘿嘿 先别着急 小伙子
Take it slow, lad.

255
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,410
搞发明创造得一步步来
We wouldn't want to push a new invention too 

256
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:48,950
不能操之过急
far too quickly.

257
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,500
一
One.

258
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,870
二
Two.

259
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,580
三
Three.

260
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,580
祖师爷
Gadzooks.

261
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,120
四
Four.

262
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,790
最多只能倒回去四秒
The limit is four seconds.

263
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:46,120
真的吗 小伙子
Are you certain, my boy? 

264
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,700
你怎么这么肯定啊
What were the indicators?

265
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:49,830
相信我
Trust me.

266
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:51,950
真的只有四秒
It's four seconds.

267
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,450
很厉害了
Amazing.

268
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,540
我们去派对 让大伙见识一下
We could show it off at the party.

269
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,450
目前还不行
We aren't done.

270
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,250
别忘了换身衣服再去派对
Please go change before the party.

271
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,580
我来试试看能不能给它增增效
I think I might know how to give it a boost.

272
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,450
增效
A boost?

273
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,450
你就当给它升个级 临时的
A momentary upgrade, if you will.

274
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,120
太好了 我们怎么开始
That's great. Where do we start?

275
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,290
就从你去参加派对开始吧
You can start by attending your party.

276
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,240
人在独处时更容易集中精神
One's thoughts are more easily gathered in isolation.

277
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,830
如果不能好好享受当下
And what's the point of a device like this

278
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:31,200
那造这个装置出来还有什么意义呢
if you don't enjoy the time you have?

279
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,910
原来你在这儿啊
There he is.

280
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,540
嘿 紧张吗 小子
Hey, nervous, kid?

281
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,410
明天可是大日子呀
Big day tomorrow.

282
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,700
我这也正犯愁呢
It's all I can think about.

283
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,450
那小姑娘在哪呢
Where's the little lady?

284
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,240
不知道
Not sure. 

285
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,950
她好像说了要来个什么惊艳登场
She said something about making an entrance.

286
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,910
她还真是喜欢搞花样 对吧
She does love a spectacle, eh?

287
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,040
是啊
Yeah.

288
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,120
我怕我明天来不及跟你说 所以...
Hey, in case I don't remember to tell you tomorrow,

289
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,120
你一直是我最重要的人 本索
you've always meant the world to me, Benzo.

290
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,080
我...你那个...
Well, you, uh...

291
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,750
你怎么还多愁善感上了
Uh, you... Oh, don't get all mushy on me now.

292
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,950
怎么把一个大男人给弄哭了
Making the big man misty, are you?

293
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,870
该死的过敏怎么又犯了
Oh, these damned allergies.

294
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,490
你应该为自己感到骄傲 艾克
You should be proud of yourself, Ekko.

295
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,000
那个Z型驱动器 爆爆觉得特了不起
Powder's been raving about your Z-Drive.

296
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,160
我都好久没见她对什么事这么激动了
Can't remember the last time I saw her so alive.

297
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:20,830
我有预感 这地方迟早得听你的
I have the feeling that you'll be running this place soon.

298
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:23,250
看来我们得抓紧机会了
So there's a chance for us yet.

299
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,250
你
You?

300
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,660
你的大日子 我怎么能错过呢 是不是
Didn't think I'd miss your big day, did you?

301
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,370
你不是想要杀了他吗
Didn't you try to kill him?

302
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,000
人生中最重要的一课
Greatest thing we can do in life is find 

303
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,160
就是要学会释怀
the power to forgive.

304
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,790
(创新者竞赛)

305
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
今晚很特别
Some night.

306
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,910
这里真美啊
It's beautiful.

307
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,250
那些舞步你从哪儿学的
Where'd you learn those moves?

308
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,540
我只是在跟着你跳
Oh, I was just following your lead.

309
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,410
还挺会说的
He's got lines.

310
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:10,750
那个
Hey. Uh...

311
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,870
我想说 谢谢你
I just want to thank you.

312
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,200
谢谢你做的一切
You know, for everything.

313
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,410
我幻想中的底城也像现在这么美好
I used to dream the undercity could be like this.

314
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,120
可不知从什么时候起 我...
But somewhere, I 

315
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,870
眼里就只能看见它的不堪
got consumed by all the ways it wasn't.

316
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,750
我放弃过它
I gave up on it.

317
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,700
也放弃过你
Gave up on you.

318
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,290
我从来没见你真的放弃过什么 艾克
I've never seen you give up on anything, Ekko.

319
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,410
有没有那么一刻
You ever wish you could 

320
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,870
时间能就此停住
just stay in one moment?

321
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,080
有时候
Sometimes 

322
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,910
想要向前一步 意味着
taking a leap forward means...

323
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,540
必须舍弃一些东西
leaving a few things behind.

324
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,250
这一刻 我永远都不会忘记
I promise I'll never forget this.

325
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,950
最好是这样
You better not.

326
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,240
对不起 我...
Sorry, I...

327
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,290
不 没关系
No... It's fine, 

328
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,250
我...
I...

329
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,450
能不能倒回去
Can we just pretend 

330
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:10,250
假装刚刚什么都没发生
like it's the first time?

331
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:50,160
艾克 小伙子 你回来得正好
Ekko, my lad. You're just in time.

332
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,540
你这增效增得也太大了吧
This is a big upgrade.

333
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,790
稍等一下
Just a moment.

334
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,870
我把最后几处电源接上 就大功告成了
I only need to hook up the final power supply.

335
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,910
这就是一切开始的地方
This is where it all started, isn't it?

336
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,040
海克斯科技
The end of Piltover.

337
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,870
毁了皮尔特沃夫
Because of Hextech.

338
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:36,500
为什么你要给我这个
Why did you ever give me this?

339
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:38,750
为什么
Why?

340
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:47,250
本来不会变成这样的 对不对
It doesn't have to go this way, right?

341
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,950
告诉我还有挽回的余地
Just tell me there's a chance.

342
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,700
早知道是这样 就该和爆爆道个歉
Oh, I do wish I could apologize to Ms. Powder

343
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,660
这玩意儿太占地方了
for co-opting her space like this.

344
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,160
希望她不会太介意
It truly was the only way.

345
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,660
把我送回去
Send me back.

346
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,620
每一刻都精彩绝伦
Never a dull moment.

347
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,830
不得不说 认识了你这个小伙子
I must say that since I've met you, lad,

348
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:19,040
- 我也此生无憾了 - 什么
- I've truly lived. - What?

349
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,870
- 我去去就来 - 不要
- Back in a wink. - No! 

350
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:24,080
黑默丁格 等等
Heimerdinger, wait! Wait!

351
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,250
我不会失败的
I won't fail.

352
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,040
绝对不会
I swear it.

353
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
不
No!

354
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,500
爆爆
Powder?

355
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,080
这是怎么了
What happened?

356
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,500
(蔚)

357
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:00,040
