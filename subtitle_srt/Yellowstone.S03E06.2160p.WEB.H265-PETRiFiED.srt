你姐妹呢
Where's your sister?

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,780
塞拉
Sila!

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,310
快点
Come on.

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,440
这孩子
That girl...

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,890
快点啊
Come on.

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,710
我们
Let's...

15
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:58,610
克里斯托
Hey, Crystal.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,710
塞拉昨晚没在你那儿过夜吧
Sila didn't spend the night there last night, did she?

17
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,830
没有吗
No?

18
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,070
不  她没有回家
No, she didn't come home.

19
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,460
谢谢
Thank you.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,590
喂  吉姆
Hello, Jim.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,620
塞拉不在吧
Sila isn't over there, is she?

22
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,880
如果她去了麻烦你告诉我一声
Well, you let me know if she comes by.

23
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,300
塞拉什么时候送她下车的
What time did Sila drop her off?

24
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,810
她说她会直接回家吗
And she said she was coming straight home?

25
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,790
塞拉
Sila!

26
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,850
塞拉
Sila!

00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:05,460

{\an8}黄石
第三季  第六集

29
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,990
我们在离这里10英里的地方找到了她的车
So, we found her car about 10 miles from here.

30
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,520
没油了
Ran out of gas.

31
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,670
没有挣扎的迹象  所以我的猜测是
There's no sign of a struggle, so my guess is

32
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:09,540
她不是搭便车就是想步行
she either hitched a ride or tried to walk it.

33
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,950
现在还不知道是哪种情况  所以我们都纳入了考虑
There's no telling which, so for now we're assuming both.

34
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,510
我得派人去找她  汤姆
I need to put together a search. Tom,

35
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:23,070
但我人手不够
and I don't have the manpower.

36
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,170
我去联系一下
I'll make some calls.

37
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,720
你问过她所有的朋友了吗
Now, you checked with all her friends?

38
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,090
都问了
Everybody.

39
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,580
现在我也不知道她生还的概率有多少
At this point, I don't know what her chances are.

40
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,080
你心里很清楚  本
You know exactly what her chances are, Ben.

41
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,430
他是谁
Who is he?

42
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,820
就是一个交易马匹  爱撒谎的
Just a horse trading, lying...

43
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,580
半个罪犯
half a criminal.

44
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:07,190
里普  把牛赶到新谷仓上面去
Rip, push those cattle up to the field above the new barn.

45
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,870
遵命
Sir.

46
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,720
你们听好了  那些狗娘养的对你们说什么
Y'all listen up, if those sons of bitches say anything to you,

47
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,260
都不要理他们  听到了吗
you don't react, you hear me?

48
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,710
保持冷静  明白吗
Cool heads. Understood?

49
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:16,830
这个混蛋会考验你们的
This bastard will try and test you.

50
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:35,250
好久不见  约翰
Long time, John.

51
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,100
对我来说还不够久  你个狗娘养的
Not long enough for me, you son of a bitch.

52
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,470
不是说要保持冷静吗
What happened to cool heads?

53
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,340
不包括我
I didn't mean me.

54
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,320
你今天又想搞什么鬼
What scam are you running today?

55
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,630
哪有
No scam.

56
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,180
我们在帮度假村放野牛呢
We're babysitting them bison for the resort.

57
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,610
度假村现在还做野牛生意了
Resort's in the buffalo business now?

58
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,490
他们从事旅游业
They're in the tourist business.

59
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,890
收六百块让人骑在上面
Charge 600 dollars for people to ride up here on a dude string

60
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,200
然后给他们拍照
and have pictures taken of 'em.

61
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,000
它们进行布鲁氏菌病检测了吗
These been tested for Brucellosis?

62
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,600
这次人不少啊
Got a whole army now, I see.

63
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,800
他每次带的人都不少  对吧  约翰
He's always got an army. Don't you, John?

64
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,340
检测没问题
Papers are good.

65
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,700
你那天为什么不给他看
Why didn't you show him that the other day?

66
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,730
因为我不喜欢他找我要的态度
'Cause I didn't like the way he asked.

67
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,770
别让我在我们的牧场看到它们
I don't want to see them things on our side of the fence.

68
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:34,320
法律说阻止它们进入不是我们的工作
Law says it's not our job to keep 'em from getting in.

69
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,320
防止它们乱跑是你们的职责
It's your job to keep 'em from getting out.

70
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,030
你应该很清楚  委员
You should know that, Commissioner.

71
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,670
我不会让它们进来的
Oh, I'll keep 'em out.

72
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,590
但你肯定不会喜欢我的方法
But you're gonna fucking hate the way I do it.

73
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,030
韦德  咱们的宿怨可有点年头了
We're a little long in the tooth for old feuds, Wade.

74
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,250
咱俩除了宿怨  啥都没有
Without old feuds I got none at all.

75
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:08,510
那还有什么乐趣呢
And where's the fun in that?

76
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,210
去参加葬礼吗
Going to a funeral?

77
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,310
海伦娜那边还有工作
Helena. Got work to do.

78
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,180
我们星期六没有工作
Won't work Saturdays for us,

79
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:43,170
但你肯定是为自己工作呗
but you're sure working for yourself.

80
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,850
我受够了
Enough of this shit.

81
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,300
我惹他生气了
I've made him mad,

82
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,700
他受不了了
and he's not going to take it anymore.

83
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,410
直奔主题吧
Let's just skip straight to the problem.

84
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,660
我们之间真正的问题
The real problem... between us.

85
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,140
大早上的
It's too early in the morning

86
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,730
翻旧账不好吧  杰米
to dig up that skeleton, Jamie.

87
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,410
反正我就翻了
Well, I'm digging it up anyway.

88
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,810
你知道你危险在哪里吗
You know what is so fucking dangerous about you

89
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,680
那就是你真的相信你在帮忙
is you actually believe that you're helping.

90
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,670
你心里真的相信
Like, in your heart, you believe that.

91
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:14,590
但是你却拒绝面对你帮助的结果
But you refuse to look at the results of your help.

92
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:20,600
你拒绝承认你的"帮助"留下的惨痛
You refuse to acknowledge the carnage that your "Help" Leaves behind.

93
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,910
因为作为一个男人  你已经废了
Because as a man you are broken.

94
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,140
你的灵魂和心灵都破碎了
Your soul, your mind is broken.

95
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:32,060
这可能不是你的错
And, it's not your fault, I guess.

96
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,590
他把你变成了一个你不想成为的人
He made you into something you had no business being.

97
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,500
这可能就是他这么做的原因
I guess that's why he did it.

98
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,100
但你没有对错之分
But there's just no right or wrong with you.

99
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,230
你只想得到他的赞同
Just his approval. That's all that matters to you.

100
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,600
你就是这样的人
That's all you are.

101
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,590
但他不赞同  以及你对此的恐惧
But his disapproval, man, and how much you fear it?

102
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,430
这才是你真正邪恶的原因  杰米
That is what makes you truly evil, Jamie.

103
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,980
你是恶人
And you are evil.

104
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,020
你知道的  你必须知道
You know that. You have to know that.

105
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,960
我所做的一切
All... All I have ever tried to do

106
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,170
都是在保护这个家
is protect this family.

107
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,820
大多数时间都是窝里斗
Most of the time, from itself.

108
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,860
你比任何人都应该清楚
You more than anyone should understand that.

109
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,690
我告诉你一个小秘密
I'm going to tell you a little secret:

110
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:31,060
你越是变成他想要的样子
the more you become what he wanted you to become,

111
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,530
他就越讨厌你
the more he'll hate you for it.

112
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,500
他是真的讨厌你
And he does hate you for it.

113
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,290
我们都讨厌你
We all do.

114
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,100
我应该拒绝的
I should've said no.

115
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,430
我就不该帮你
That's what I should've done.

116
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:56,670
因为这样你怀不上孩子
because then you couldn't blame me for doing exactly

117
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,000
就怪不到我头上了
what you asked me to do.

118
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,370
我没让你帮我切除子宫
I didn't ask you for a fucking hysterectomy.

119
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,320
当一个人给其他人带来痛苦时
You know, when you consider the pain that you cause a person

120
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,380
这个人的错
the person's fault...

121
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,720
太邪恶了  杰米
that's evil, Jamie.

122
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,630
你说这很简单的
You said this would be simple.

123
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,720
按理说是很简单
It should have been.

124
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:01,400
"按理说"就是废话
"Should" Is a useless word.

125
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,140
和"希望"差不多
Almost as useless as "Hope."

126
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,540
他没有改第二个桶的引导  是吗
He didn't change leads around that second barrel, did he?

127
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,500
你够快的话  管他怎么引导的呢
If you're running fast enough it don't matter what lead you're on.

128
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,550
这俩绕桶赛手都挺厉害的
These barrel racers is hands, I'll say that.

129
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,460
宝贝  你能给我扔瓶水吗
Could you toss me a water, babe?

130
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,860
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, sugar.

131
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,560
靠
Damn.

132
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,800
两支舞
Two dances.

133
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,560
我就把她们拉到马场
Here, I'm hauling them to the arena,

134
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,320
帮她们备马  坐在看台上看她们表演了
saddling their horses, sitting in the bleachers watching 'em.

135
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,490
现在我成了牛仔浪妹
Now I'm the damn buckle bunny.

136
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,200
你们没有
You guys didn't, uh...

137
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:44,520
当然没有  她还不到25岁
'Course not. She ain't even 25 years old.

138
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:48,120
绕桶赛手就跟痔疮一样  离我越远越好
I need a barrel racer in my life like I need another hemorrhoid.

139
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,550
但我还是在这里帮她拿东西
But here I am anyway, toting her shit around.

140
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,790
你的女人养不起啊
That's a lot of woman you got there.

141
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,230
你住在工棚里  怎么能满足她呢
She's gonna want more than you can offer living in a bunkhouse.

142
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:01,070
我本来想靠骑烈马离开工棚的
Rodeo was supposed to be my way out of the bunkhouse.

143
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,990
骑烈马和当牛仔一样  不适合谈恋爱
Rodeo's as bad on relationships as cowboying.

144
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:11,350
没办法分心的  吉米
Can't be married to two things at the same time, Jimmy.

145
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,000
所以你在摔成这个鬼样子
That's what got you banged up in the first place

146
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:16,840
因为你当时在想她
was thinking about her

147
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,680
没有好好骑那匹烈马
instead of that rocket you was getting on.

148
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,920
反正达顿先生也不让我骑了
Mr. Dutton says I can't do it anymore anyway.

149
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,580
他也跟我说过一次
He told me that too, once.

150
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:33,320
就在他帮我付了一堆医院账单之后
Right after he paid a stack of my hospital bills.

151
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,160
但唯一能决定要不要继续骑烈马的人是你自己
But the only one that can decide if you rodeo is you.

152
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,450
要不我再参加一次
Maybe I can just do another event.

153
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,430
组队套索
Team rope, maybe.

154
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,870
你拿根十英尺长的绳子都套不到柱子
You can't rope a post with a ten foot loop.

155
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:55,470
但我从来没见过骑烈马像你骑得这么好的
But you can sit a bucking horse like nothin' I ever seen.

156
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,080
反正我退出以后是没见过了
Least well since I quit, anyway.

157
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,820
我不知道我该怎么办
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

158
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,650
别想太多
You gotta leave your brain out of it,

159
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,910
用心去决定
decide with your heart.

160
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,700
只有这样才不会后悔
It's the only way you'll ever have peace with it.

161
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,920
你什么时候决定退出的
When did you decide to quit?

162
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,500
我的身体替我做了决定
My body decided for me.

163
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,490
现在我每天早上能起床就不错了
Now, it's all I can do to get out of bed every morning.

164
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,710
我想念那种感觉
I miss it.

165
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,390
嗯  我也很想念
Yeah. I miss it too.

166
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,290
谢谢
Thank you.

167
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,210
达顿委员
Commissioner Dutton.

168
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,030
真是太有意思了
It's funny how I can say the same thing

169
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,700
这个称呼几周就换了三个人
and it mean three different people in just as many weeks.

170
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,040
世事无常嘛
Yeah, well, the more things change, you know.

171
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,070
希望不要换汤不换药
I certainly hope they don't stay the same.

172
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,260
我也是
Me, too.

173
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,380
有什么事吗
What can I do for you?

174
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,170
我们这里有个人失踪了
We've got a missing person.

175
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,880
我们这里经常有人失踪
We always have a missing person,

176
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,890
但我们人手老是不够
but we never have the resources to find them.

177
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,780
我已经忍不了了
I'm getting pretty tired of that staying the same.

178
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,770
我不知道我能帮多少忙
Well, I'm not sure how much help I can be

179
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,210
但我尽量  你是这个意思吧
but you've got it, if that's what you're asking for.

180
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:46,140
有三个探员在那附近
I got three agents close by.

181
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,450
三小时后到
Be there in three hours.

182
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,660
三个也行吧
Three more is something.

183
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,480
你只需要探员
Are you just looking for badges

184
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,000
还是志愿者也行
or do you need volunteers, too?

185
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,630
我们也在招募志愿者团体
We're putting together volunteer groups as well.

186
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:58,030
我打个电话  看看能不能在帮你找点人
I'll make a call. See if I can't get you some more.

187
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,420
谢谢
Thank you.

188
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,550
谢谢你来见我们
Appreciate you meeting us.

189
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,520
客气
My pleasure.

190
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,280
这是市场股票的首席执行官
This is Market Equities' CEO.

191
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,350
-我是威拉·海斯  -杰米·达顿
- I'm Willa Hayes. - Jamie Dutton.

192
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,180
我们从哪里开始呢
Where should we start?

193
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,540
这是个好问题  杰米
That's a really good question, Jamie.

194
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,550
我没有答案  我真的不知道
I don't have the answer. I really don't know.

195
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,850
我们可以先聊聊你妹的公司卖空我们的股票
We could start with your sister's firm shorting our stock

196
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,080
现在已经成为华尔街的闹剧了
to the point it has become a Wall Street play.

197
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,370
-什么  -我们可以先聊聊那个
- Doing what? - We could start there.

198
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,320
我们也可以聊聊你现在的任职
We could start with being appointed to an office

199
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,400
正好可以没收你家人的财产
that very well could be tasked with condemning your family's property,

200
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,680
但这是一个严重的利益冲突
but that's an obscene conflict of interest.

201
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,560
现在谈论没收有点为时过早吧
I think it's a bit premature to talk condemnation.

202
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,810
你们还没有对土地进行报价呢
You haven't made an offer on the land.

203
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,480
州政府正在购买土地
The State is buying the land.

204
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,020
州政府还没有批准
The State hasn't approved that.

205
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,580
州政府批准这样的收购
And to approve such a purchase the State

206
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,170
需要一个债券倡议
would require a bond initiative

207
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,090
在秋季投票之前
proposed and voted on by the assembly

208
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,210
得到州议会提议并表决通过
before being placed on the fall ballot.

209
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,970
但是你在这里一边要求
And yet, here you are, demanding that

210
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,010
州政府违反了自己的程序
the State violate its own procedures

211
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,540
一边指控州长违反程序
while you accusing the Governor of violating procedure.

212
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:27,810
成千上万的工作机会
Thousands of jobs.

213
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,230
成千上万的低薪服务工作
Thousands of low paying service jobs.

214
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,150
其他州的技术工人肯定会过来
Skilled labor, I'm sure, will come from out of state.

215
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,110
这会让房价进一步提高
Which will drive the home prices even higher,

216
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,840
前提是你们得逞了
if that's possible.

217
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,230
你在抬高价格  把山谷的人逼走
You're pricing people out of the valley.

218
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,300
他们已经被逼出了山谷  不关我的事
They're already priced out of the valley. That's not my doing.

219
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
这叫经济演化
It's called economic evolution.

220
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,310
我不同意
I disagree.

221
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,370
你不是不同意
You don't disagree.

222
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,890
你只是不希望这是真的
You just don't want it to be true.

223
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,310
我有个建议
I have a proposal.

224
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,650
洗耳恭听
I'm all ears.

225
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,360
不劳烦州政府买地了
Rather than the State buying the land,

226
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,160
我给你一个报价
I'm gonna make you an offer.

227
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,470
一亩一万  买你的五万亩地
Your fifty thousand acres for ten thousand dollars an acre.

228
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,880
这可是五亿
That's five hundred million dollars.

229
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:10,080
你们永远也不会为钱发愁了
You'll never be priced out of anything... ever again.

230
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,260
现在不要回答我  好好琢磨一下这个数字
Don't answer me now. Let that number sink in.

231
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,510
我们和州长见面时再讨论这个问题
We'll discuss this again at our meeting with the Governor.

232
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,600
看到那个表情了吗
You see that look?

233
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,360
欲望  对吧  搞定他肯定没问题
Desire. Right? We'll close him.

234
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,980
他并不是最难搞定的人
I don't think he's the hard one to close.

235
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,040
把武器留在卡车里
I'd leave them weapons in the truck.

236
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,580
我们今天不执法
We ain't enforcing no laws today.

237
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,130
好主意
That's good thinking.

238
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,850
如果你们愿意的话  我可以再弄几匹
I can get a few more up here if you want.

239
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,560
谢谢
It's appreciated.

240
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,190
我尽力了
This is all I could wrangle.

241
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,900
我也想再找点人
Wish there were more.

242
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,310
谢谢大家的帮助
It all helps.

243
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,410
伙计们  听着
All right, folks, listen up.

244
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,120
每个人相距十英尺
Everybody stays ten feet apart.

245
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,620
搜寻周围的区域
You scan the area around you.

246
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,600
不要只找塞拉  好吗
No don't just look for Sila, right?

247
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,170
还要找衣服  脚印
You look for clothes, footprints,

248
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,800
一部手机  一串钥匙
a phone, a set of keys.

249
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,470
如果你发现什么  不要碰它
If you find something, do not touch it.

250
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,430
你站在上面  然后大喊
You stand over it, and you shout "hey,"

251
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,470
挥舞你的手臂
and you wave your arm.

252
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,980
警官会过来的
An officer will come to you.

253
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,400
好了  行动吧
All right, let's go.

254
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,080
你认识她吗
Do you know her?

255
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:58,960
我认识她
I know her.

256
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,500
好孩子
Good kid.

257
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,590
但这种事只会发生在好孩子身上
But this only happens to good kids.

258
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,270
那是狼吗
Is that a wolf?

259
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,400
郊狼
Coyote.

260
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,230
告诉他们别靠近了
Tell them not to come any closer.

261
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,050
大家停下
Everybody stop.

262
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,470
怎么了  他们找到什么了吗
What's happening, did they find something?

263
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,560
是的
They found something.

264
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,400
现场交给你了  本
The scene is yours, Ben.

265
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,570
我们去通知她妈妈
Let's go tell her mother.

266
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,870
布置现场
Set up a crime perimeter.

267
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:50,640
{\an8}《骑野牛的人》
}第三集  结局第一部分

268
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,280
这是我这辈子见过的最蠢的事
This is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life.

269
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:57,290
太精彩了
Oh, it's so good.

270
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:00,270
你只是不喜欢高质量的电影制作而已
You just don't appreciate quality film making.

271
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,640
我觉得他看起来像
I mean, I feel like he just looks like

272
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,480
有点性感的耶稣骑在野牛上
some kind of like sexy Jesus on the buffalo riding to the--

273
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,630
没人知道你在说什么
No one knows what you're saying.

274
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:09,320
没人能听懂
No one can understand you.

275
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,250
你能听懂  对吧
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?

276
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,990
他怎么不会摔下来啊
How is he staying on that fucking thing?

277
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,070
-它不会弓背啊  -真的吗
- Well, it can't buck. - Really?

278
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:18,450
不会弓背  不会抬臀
Can't buck, can't rear up.

279
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,540
但它们可以把人滚下来
But they can roll over on your ass.

280
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,040
有人能解释一下他俩的动态吗
I need this whole dynamic explained to me.

281
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,490
一定是因为地球的抖动  造成了一个磁移
It must be the wobble of the earth, creating a magnetic shift--

282
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,530
这就是他被枪击的地方
This is where he gets shot.

283
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:32,740
小心啊  小心
Look out. Look out!

284
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:38,470
我们可以在草场骑野牛啊
Hey, we oughta ride the buffalo out there on that field.

285
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:39,850
等等  什么草场
Wait, what field?

286
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,580
畜栏后面
Out back there behind the corral.

287
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,750
你们的畜栏在哪里
Where are your corrals?

288
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,190
他们能听懂她说话
She speaks, they understand her.

289
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,170
这怎么可能
How is that even possible?

290
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,590
我不是说了么  因为地球的抖动
It's the wobble of the earth, I'm trying to tell you.

291
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,010
畜栏旁边的草场哪有野牛
There ain't no buffalo out in the field by the corrals.

292
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:55,890
有三十只左右
There's about thirty.

293
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,280
度假村把它们放在那里供游客观赏
The resort put them there for tourists to look at.

294
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,530
还找了一个卑鄙的老混蛋看着它们
And they got this mean old bastard watching them.

295
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,790
-他叫什么名字来着  -韦德什么的
- What was his name? - Wade something.

296
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,810
-韦德  -莫罗
- Wade... - Morrow.

297
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,230
是的  那是他的野牛
Yeah, they're his buffalo.

298
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,070
谁想骑野牛
Who feels like riding a buffalo?

299
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,670
我不想
Not me.

300
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:15,120
我想骑  但是
Yeah, I would, but, uh...

301
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,800
我不能酒后骑野牛
I'm not supposed to drink and ride buffalos.

302
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,510
你懂的
It's a whole thing.

303
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:20,050
去他妈的  我要骑野牛
Fuck it, I'll ride a buffalo.

304
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:22,660
没错  我们要骑  你们这群老娘们可以看着
Yeah, we'll ride the buffalo. You ladies can watch.

305
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,690
有意思
This is gonna be fun.

306
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:28,590
-等等  真的要骑吗  -可不呗
- Wait. This is happening? - Looks like it.

307
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:33,090
我这辈子干过一些蠢事
I've done some dumb shit in my life.

308
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,090
但肯定没这个蠢
This is gonna be dumber.

309
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,660
有什么好办法吗
Well, what's the best way to do this?

310
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,310
不能用绳子套住它们的脖子
Well, you can't rope them around the neck.

311
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,440
这样会破坏它们的喉头
You'll crush their larynx.

312
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,830
所以只能套住它们的角
So you gotta rope them by their horns.

313
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,480
然后呢
And then what?

314
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,150
然后把它们拉住
And then you pull them to a stop.

315
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,300
跳上去就行了
You jump on and off you go--

316
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,950
我只是来看看的
I'm just here to watch.

317
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,070
我来
I'll do it.

318
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,740
这必须得喝一点
We can't be sober for this.

319
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,160
操  它们多可爱啊
Shit, what a baby bunch.

320
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,950
绕桶赛女孩会害死我们的
Barrel racer girls are gonna get us killed.

321
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,690
而且她们都不是我们的人
And they ain't even our girls.

322
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:46,930
好样的
Atta girl!

323
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:47,710
你没事吧
You all right?

324
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,460
太爽了
That was fuckin' awesome.

325
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,590
下一个是谁
Who's next?

326
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,340
到我了
Fuck me, baby.

327
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,390
再套一头吧
Let's go rope another one.

328
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,210
感觉好点了吗
Feeling any better?

329
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,960
这是不对的
It's just not right.

330
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,260
的确
No, it's not.

331
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,100
世界上到处都是怪物
There's monsters everywhere in this world.

332
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,770
找到以后就立即处决
You just gotta kill them when you find them.

333
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,310
但你找不到它们
But you can't find them.

334
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,990
他们甚至没有足够的警察来寻找受害者
Hell, they don't even have enough police to look for the victims.

335
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:02,120
我还好意思坐在浴缸里
And here I am, sitting in this swimming pool of a bathtub.

336
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,540
你不要自责  宝贝
You can't make it your fault, baby.

337
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:10,040
我不是在自责  我只是在思考解决办法
I'm not making it my fault. I'm making it my problem.

338
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:16,000
莫妮卡  你知道我们无法阻止这个腐朽的世界
You know we can't stop the world from being bad, Monica.

339
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,930
这并不意味着我们不能尝试
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try.

340
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,950
早上好  爸爸
Good morning, daddy.

341
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,410
今早是挺好的
Yes, it is.

342
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,830
你在练瑜伽吗
Have you been practicing yoga?

343
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,460
练习什么
Practicing what?

344
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,840
我只是在捉摸你为什么心平气和的
I'm just trying to understand this new inner peace you've found.

345
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,150
这个地方面对的
What this place is facing...

346
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,780
不是敌人
it isn't an enemy.

347
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,150
而是一种观点
It's a perspective.

348
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,700
价值观的转变
It's a shift in values.

349
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,620
世界不再重视你的生活方式了  爸爸
The world doesn't value your way of life anymore, Dad.

350
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,420
我知道
I know.

351
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:40,920
你不能把这场战斗交给杰米
You can't delegate this fight to fuckin' Jamie.

352
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:44,010
好吧  还有
Okay, and...

353
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:48,360
凯斯  他没有耐心和技巧
Kayce, he just doesn't have the patience or the skill.

354
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,220
还有
And...

355
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,690
我一个人做不到
I can't do it by myself.

356
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,360
但你必须做到  亲爱的
But you have to, honey.

357
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,250
你得教导凯斯
You have to teach Kayce.

358
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:03,780
以及学会如何信任杰米
And you have to learn how to trust Jamie.

359
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,780
相信杰米
Trust Jamie?

360
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:11,800
等等  是你
Wait, you're the...

361
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,330
是你告诉我不能相信杰米的
you're the one telling I shouldn't trust Jamie.

362
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,390
贝丝  就算我再保这里十年
What does it matter, Beth, if I keep this place

363
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,310
然后因为你想不明白  你们三个丢弃了这片土地
for another ten years and the three of you lose it

364
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,730
那还有什么意义呢
because you couldn't figure it out?

365
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,600
-不  -贝丝
- No. - Beth...

366
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,210
你不了解他
You don't know him!

367
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:25,470
贝丝  你知道什么我们其他人不知道的吗
And what is it you know, Beth, that the rest of us don't?

368
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,010
他做了什么  贝丝
What did he do, Beth?

369
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,180
他做了什么
What did he do?

370
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,730
贝丝  如果你不告诉我  我可帮不了你
I can't help you, Beth if you won't tell me what it is.

371
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,810
停车  老莫
Pull over, Mo.

372
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,340
你在做什么
What are you doing?

373
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,430
寻找线索
Looking for clues.

374
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,180
想帮帮忙
Trying to help.

375
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,100
你在这里唯一能发现的就是
The only thing you're going to find out here

376
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,810
她之前所发现的
is exactly what she found.

377
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,850
这帮不上什么忙
That's not gonna help anything.

378
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,190
这不公平
It's not fair.

379
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,070
嗯  当然
No. It certainly isn't.

380
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:12,780
但是从一开始就是这样设计的
But it was designed that way. From the beginning.

381
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,990
我们不应该在这里
We're not supposed to be here.

382
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,250
保留地本来只是个暂时的落脚点
Reservations were supposed to be temporary.

383
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,960
我们应该学习白人
We were supposed to learn how to be white

384
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,670
去城市生活
and then go live in cities

385
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:28,220
然后这块地也会被卖掉
and then this land would be sold, too.

386
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,220
但我们没有学习白人
But we didn't learn to be white.

387
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,810
我们不想学
Wouldn't.

388
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,060
现在弄成了这样
And now here we are.

389
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,440
政府不会帮忙  因为他们不想帮忙
The government won't help because it doesn't want to.

390
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,650
政府想让我们死
It wants us to die.

391
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,110
政府想让我们离开
It wants us gone.

392
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,610
因为政府想要土地
Because it wants the land.

393
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,700
这是政府一直以来的诉求
And that's all it's ever wanted.

394
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,080
所以我想要回我们的土地
That's why I want our land back.

395
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,250
所有的土地
All of it.

396
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,380
这样我们就可以构建他们无法夺走的生命
So we can build lives that they can't take away.

397
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,510
我能帮上什么忙
How do I help?

398
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,760
我要组建一个理事会
I'm forming a council

399
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,350
重点针对保留地妇女遭遇暴力问题
to focus on violence against women on the reservation.

400
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,520
我要把我们的故事传递到大学
It will take our stories to the universities.

401
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,810
到国会  传递给愿意倾听的人们
To Congress. To anyone who will listen.

402
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:27,480
我们的第一场战斗是反对被忽视的现状
Our first fight is against being ignored.

403
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,200
你愿意领导这场战斗吗
Would you like to lead that fight?

404
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,700
我可以
I could lead that fight.

405
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:38,450
那你就算帮上忙了
That's how you help.

406
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,420
太好了
Oh, good.

407
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,030
我想和你谈谈
I need to talk to you about something.

408
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,240
市场股票集团提出
The Market Equities Group made an--

409
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,680
我这辈子做过这么多承诺  儿子
Of all the promises I've made in my life, son.

410
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,850
要不是我那么爱你母亲
If I didn't love your mother so much...

411
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,520
我肯定会食言
I would break it.

412
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,450
我发誓我肯定会食言
I swear to God I would break it.

413
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,410
出什么事了吗  什么情况
Did something happen? I don't understand.

414
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,320
三十年后怎么办  杰米
What happens in thirty years, Jamie?

415
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,290
等你和你的兄弟姐妹老了
When you, and your brother and sister

416
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,590
无法为这里而战
are too old to fight for this place

417
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,090
泰特就只能孤身作战了吗
and Tate has to fight for it on his own?

418
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,530
你在说什么
What are you talking about?

419
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,670
李不会结婚  他不想要孩子
Lee wouldn't marry, didn't want children.

420
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,260
我怀疑你也一样
I doubt you will either.

421
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,300
现在你妹因为你怀不上孩子了
And now your sister can't. She can't because of you.

422
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,250
-爸  等等  -别动
- Dad, wait, wait. - Quit moving!

423
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,380
我没有
I didn't.

424
00:34:27,770 --> 00:34:29,630
我  操
I-- Fuck.

425
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,630
是她来找我的
She came to me.

426
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,720
她很害怕
She was scared.

427
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,280
我也很害怕
I was scared.

428
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,350
你为什么要让她绝育  杰米
Why would you take that from her, Jamie?

429
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,430
你凭什么让她绝育
Who the fuck did you think you were to take that from her?

430
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,690
怎么了
What the hell is going on here?

431
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,570
问你哥
Ask your brother.

432
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,250
我所做的一切都是在付出
All I do is give!

433
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,730
我恨他  我恨死他了
I hate him. I fucking hate him.

434
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,550
我恨你
I fucking hate you!

435
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,310
这一切都是徒劳的
It's all for nothing.

436
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,520
我所做的一切
Everything I've done. It's...

437
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,980
都是徒劳无功
It's all for nothing.
