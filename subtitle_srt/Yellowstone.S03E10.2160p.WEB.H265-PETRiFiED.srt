你肯定醉的不轻  才会这么做
You must've been really drunk to do that.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,480
做什么
Do what?

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,190
这个
This.

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,360
你为什么要这么做
Why in the hell would you do that?

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,700
说来话长
It's kind of a long story.

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,450
我有时间啊
I got time.

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:36,660
靠  我没有时间了
Oh, shit. No, I don't.

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,950
我得走了
Get moving.

拉勒米  我们
Laramie, let's...

17
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,050
不是吧
Seriously?

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,970
拉勒米  醒醒  迟到了
Laramie. Wake up. We're late.

19
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:56,680
走吧
Let's go.

23
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,430
如果你想找寻这里的回忆
If you're looking for a connection to this place,

24
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,390
你是找不到的
you're not gonna find it.

25
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:06,560
这里是租的
This is just a rental.

26
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,230
我想找的不是回忆
It's not a connection to this place that I'm looking for.

27
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:18,820
我有兄弟姐妹  表亲吗
Do I have any brothers? Cousins? Sisters?

28
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,660
你想决定什么
What are you trying to decide?

29
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,580
我的家人
Who my family is.

30
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,130
那已经决定了
Well, that's already been decided.

31
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:36,300
你在东蒙大拿州有几个表亲
You got a couple cousins in east Montana

32
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,340
还有一个同父异母的兄弟
and a half brother somewhere...

33
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,310
你爷爷躲在法戈的一家疗养院
Your grandfather is holed up in a nursing home in Fargo.

34
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,390
那个混蛋快一百岁了
Bastard's nearly a hundred and he is living proof

35
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,190
他就是好人不长命的证明
that only the good die young.

36
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,730
还有我
And there's me.

37
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,860
你知道我的过去
You know what I am.

38
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,950
你妈妈
And your mother...

39
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,330
我记得我出门  开长途拉牛
I remember I'd been out long-hauling goddamn cattle.

40
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,410
我回家时
I came home,

41
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,340
发现你在尖叫
and I found you screaming...

42
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,750
因为你快饿死了
'cause you were fucking starving.

43
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,630
你拿着一个旧裂纹管
You had a hold of an old crack pipe

44
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,430
吮吸它的一端
and you were sucking on the tip of it

45
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,640
你以为它是乳头
like it was a nipple...

46
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,640
边叫边吸
in between screams.

47
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,940
我发现她弯腰趴在水池上
And I found her bent over the sink

48
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,360
被一个胖子
by some fat piece of shit...

49
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:40,240
我知道你只有一次机会
and I knew that you had only one chance

50
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,330
但你的人生中不能有她
in life, and that was without her in it.

51
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:49,830
所以我动手了
So, I did what I did...

52
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,590
我夺走了她的生命  放弃了我的生命
I took her life and gave up mine.

53
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:57,800
都是为了你
For you...

54
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,890
现在看着你  可以说这是我
Looking at you now, I would say that it was probably

55
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:05,390
当时最好的选择
the best choice I could've made.

56
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,350
虽然约翰·杜顿养大了你
John Dutton may have raised you,

57
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:16,150
但他爱过你吗  儿子
but did he love you, son?

58
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,030
他现在爱你吗
Does he love you now?

59
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,370
他爱的是牧场
He loves a goddamn ranch.

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,830
这就是他所爱的一切
That's all he's ever loved.

61
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,920
你站在我的院子  就说明你已经知道了
You standing in my yard tells me you already knew it.

62
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,090
你只剩我一个家人了  儿子
I'm your family, son. I'm the only one you got.

63
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,130
我为之奋斗的一切
Everything that I worked for.

64
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,510
我之前的身份
Everything that I thought I was...

65
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,890
都要没了
I'm going to lose.

66
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,650
我从小的目标就是经营那个牧场
I was raised to run that ranch.

67
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,820
我把它变成了今天的样子
I built it into what it is today.

68
00:05:59,190 --> 00:05:59,980
那就经营吧
Then run it.

69
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,650
它不是我的
It's not mine.

70
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,120
那个牧场是非卖品  况且我也买不起
It's not for sale. Not that I could afford it.

71
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,620
没有人买得起黄石
Nobody can afford Yellowstone.

72
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,080
黄石不是一个牧场
Yellowstone ain't a ranch.

73
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,210
而是一个帝国  帝国是要靠抢的
It's an empire. Empires you take.

74
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,710
我不知道该怎么抢
I don't know how to do that.

75
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,210
这是地球上最简单的事情
Oh, it's the simplest thing on earth.

76
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,670
杀了国王
You kill the King.

77
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,520
我不会杀人
I'm not a killer.

78
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,110
你没杀过人吗
You've never killed?

79
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:45,570
你杀过人
Yeah, you've killed.

80
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,290
你已经杀过人了
Of course, you've killed.

81
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,620
你是兰德尔家的人
You're a Randall.

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
杀戮是我们唯一的天赋
And killing is our only gift.

83
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,940
抱歉
Sorry.

84
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,530
不用道歉
Don't be sorry.

85
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:10,910
这需要时间
It takes time.

86
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,040
现在我明白你的感受了
Guess I know what it feels like to be you now.

87
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,040
是啊  而且还不止一方面
Yeah. In more ways than one.

88
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,420
我们搬到牧场是为了和你在一起
You know, we moved to the ranch to be with you

89
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,750
可你现在都不在牧场待着了
and now you're never here.

90
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:30,510
这个牲畜委员会委员
This, uh... this livestock thing.

91
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,180
这是一份全职工作
It's a full time job.

92
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,770
你挺喜欢的吧
You like it, don't you?

93
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,110
我喜欢为了人去奋斗
I like having somebody to fight for.

94
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,280
而不是为了什么东西
Rather than some thing.

95
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,330
当你为一个东西奋斗时
When you fight for a thing,

96
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,250
它并不在乎输赢
the thing don't care if you win or lose

97
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,710
因为它没有生命
because the thing ain't alive.

98
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,210
但当你为人奋斗时  他们会在乎
But when you fight for people, they care.

99
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,300
是啊  这也是我喜欢的地方
Yeah, that's what I like about it, too.

100
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:12,970
但我觉得东西也会在乎  土地也会在乎
But I think a thing can care. I think the land cares.

101
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,560
我明白你的意思  宝贝
I know you do, baby.

102
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,350
这就是我爱你的地方
That's what I love about you.

103
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,670
我们真正关心的是
What we're really concerned

104
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,090
是高收益和杠杆贷款
with is high yield and leverage loans...

105
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,710
过去的25年里
Interest rates globally have been in secular decline

106
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,590
全球利率一直在下降
for the past 25-plus years...

107
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,560
请留言  我回头打给你
Leave me a message and I'll call you back.

108
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,730
就是看看你怎么样了
Just checking in with you

109
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,520
因为你一直没和我联系
'cause you haven't checked in with me.

110
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,820
你的办公室有个阳台
You know, your office has a balcony.

111
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:18,580
我可在阳台以看到停车场
From the balcony, I see the parking lot.

112
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,830
我在屋顶可以看到保留地
From the roof I see the reservation.

113
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,840
我更喜欢停车场
I like the view of the parking lot better.

114
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,760
你可以祈祷我们不是你的人  但我们是的
You know, you can wish we weren't your people, but we are.

115
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,720
这并不是我所祈祷的
That's not what I wish.

116
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,090
那你在祈祷什么  安吉拉
What do you wish, Angela?

117
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,470
我祈祷我可以回到过去
I wish I could go back in time

118
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,440
告诉我们的人卖掉所有的武器
and tell our people to sell every weapon they have.

119
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,810
马匹
Every horse.

120
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,650
然后拿着钱去纽约
Then take that money and go to New York

121
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,610
雇佣市里最大的律师事务所
and hire the biggest law firm in the city.

122
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,870
如果可以的话  我们就不用站在这里了
If I could do that, we wouldn't be standing here.

123
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,620
我们可以站在黄石的门口
We'd be standing at the gates of Yellowstone

124
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,200
依然称之为我们的家
and still calling it home.

125
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,960
我们还会站在那里的
We'll stand there again.

126
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,790
和你在一起就不可能
Not with you we won't.

127
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,800
所谓的道德根本不存在
There's no such thing as morality.

128
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,970
有人拥有土地  也有人失去土地
There's own the land and there's lose the land.

129
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,010
这就是评判的标准
That's all you'll be judged by.

130
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,390
过程不重要
Not how you do it.

131
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,980
胜利者是不会被追究"过程"的
Winners are never judged by "how".

132
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,020
那是给失败者留着的
They save that for the losers.

133
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,620
你一晚上都没回来
You had a long night.

134
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:48,960
是啊
Yeah.

135
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,090
谢谢  亲爱的
Thank you, sweetie.

136
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,430
你杀了谁
Who'd you kill?

137
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,180
别问我这种问题  贝丝
Don't ask me that, Beth.

138
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,310
你杀了谁
Who'd you kill?

139
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,860
我说什么来着
What did I just say?

140
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,450
我们不能再这样了
We don't get to do that anymore.

141
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,660
哪样
What's that?

142
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,330
秘密
Secrets.

143
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,000
不能再有秘密了
We don't get those.

144
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,300
有些事我必须去做
There's things I do,

145
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,880
还有一些事我必须去摆平
and then there's things that I got to get done.

146
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,970
这些事你肯定不想听
You don't want to know them.

147
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,810
这不是秘密  亲爱的  我是为了你好
It's not a secret, Darling. It's a favor.

148
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,100
有多少
How many?

149
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,360
够了
Enough.

150
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:00,950
有多少事
How many?

151
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,990
这个牧场很大  贝丝
It's a big ranch, Beth.

152
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,330
我们的敌人不会公平战斗  你知道的
And our enemies don't fight fair, you know that.

153
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,250
多少
How many?

154
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,920
说真的  我也不知道
I don't know. Honestly.

155
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,760
别假装你不知道我们是怎么战斗的
Don't pretend like you don't know how we fight.

156
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,980
我当然知道
Oh, I know how you fight...

157
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,440
我赞同尼采关于是非的思想
I subscribe to Nietzsche's thoughts on right and wrong.

158
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,320
他是一位德国哲学家
He was a German philosopher who died of syphilis

159
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,950
收留妓女之后死于梅毒
after he cornholed some prostitute,

160
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,660
所以生活模式没什么好追求的
so not exactly a life to model yours after,

161
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:49,370
但他关于对与错  善与恶的思想
but his thoughts on right and wrong, good and evil.

162
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,870
就是根本没有对错善恶
Which were: there's no such thing.

163
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,250
这点我是相信的
That, I believe.

164
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,510
我相信要全身心地去爱
I believe in loving with your whole soul

165
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,430
如果有人想杀死你的所爱  就格杀勿论
and destroying anything that wants to kill what you love.

166
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:08,680
仅此而已
That's it.

167
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,140
就这么简单
That's all there is.

168
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,770
我也相信这一点
I believe in the same thing.

169
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,000
我收回那句话
I take it back.

170
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,370
你可以保守这个秘密
You can keep this secret.

171
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,170
失陪了
Now if you'll excuse me...

172
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,550
我也要杀个人
I gotta kill someone, too.

173
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,640
准备好了吗
You ready for this?

174
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:09,020
他们惹错人了  老爸
They fucked with the wrong bull, daddy.

175
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:10,940
是的
Yes, they did.

176
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,690
再见
I'll see you there.

177
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,110
你想要的东西  我拿到了
That thing you wanted back. I got it.

178
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,230
要我放在什么地方吗
Want me to put it some place?

179
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,280
不  我不想要
Naw, I don't want it.

180
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,900
只是不想让他拥有
Just didn't want him to have it...

181
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,580
他不会再来拿回去了吧
He's not gonna come looking for it, is he?

182
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,740
不会  先生
No, sir.

183
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,040
那趟火车只朝一个方向前进
That train only runs in one direction.

184
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,000
你查到他背后的人了吗
You find out who was holding his leash?

185
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,040
是个叫罗尔克的家伙
It's a guy by the name of Roarke.

186
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,250
我不认识他
I don't know who he is.

187
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,540
罗尔克
Roarke.

188
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,760
要我打听一下吗
Want me to start asking around?

189
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:42,090
不需要
No. No need.

190
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,550
一般人丢了狗
When people lose their dogs

191
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,430
都会到处问有没有人见过它们
they ask everyone if they've seen them.

192
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,810
他很快就会出现了
He'll show up soon enough.

193
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:50,020
好的  先生  有什么需要就找我
Yes, sir. Let me know if you need anything.

194
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,400
怎么了
What?

195
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,660
嗯  终于看到一个计划成功了
Well, it's nice to see a plan work out for once.

196
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,200
你的计划真的成功了  爸
I guess your plan did work out, Dad.

197
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:12,830
嗯
Well...

198
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,380
不是我的计划
Not my plan. My...

199
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,920
可能是我的梦想吧  但这是你的计划
My dream, maybe, but... Your plan.

200
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:24,470
有一说一  这是你为我打造的计划
Your plan for me, if you want to get down to it.

201
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,680
好吧  有一说一
All right, well, if you want to get down to it,

202
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,810
如果这不是你的命运  我的计划根本就不重要
it don't matter what my plan was if it ain't your destiny.

203
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,980
我不相信命运
I don't believe in destiny.

204
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,070
也是
Yeah, right.

205
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:41,780
就算是你  也没那么天真
Even you aren't that naive.

206
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:46,280
爸
Hey, Dad.

207
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:50,280
过得开心点
Have a good day.

208
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,540
不可能  儿子
I won't, son.

209
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,670
我的好日子已经结束了
I believe I'm all out of those.

210
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,270
拉勒米  走吧
Come on, Laramie. Let's go.

211
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,190
来了
I'm coming.

212
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,520
-东西都收拾好了吗  -嗯
- You have everything? - Yeah.

213
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,820
-马匹装车了吗  -嗯
- Horses loaded? - Oh, yeah.

214
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,200
都准备好了
We're all set.

215
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,620
-怎么了  -没什么
- What? - Nothin.

216
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,290
怎么啦
What?

217
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,080
说吧  为什么
Go ahead, why?

218
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:20,790
这有点难以解释
It's kind of hard to explain.

219
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:22,880
可不嘛  我真是想不明白
Yeah, I'd think so. I can't make sense of it.

220
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,340
沃克也有一个
Walker has one, too.

221
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,260
他把屁眼印在胸前我都不在乎
But he could have his asshole on his chest and I wouldn't care.

222
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,340
他真是个好男人
That is one fine son of a bitch.

223
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,140
你知道烙印意味着什么吗
Do you know what a brand means?

224
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:33,470
-意味着我是某个东西的一部分  -并不是
- Means I'm a part of something. - No, that's not what it means.

225
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,270
东西打上烙印以后  万一丢了
You brand something so that if it gets lost

226
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,430
大家都知道它属于谁
everyone knows who it belongs to.

227
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,640
所以才要打上烙印
That's why you do it.

228
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,220
早上好
Good morning.

229
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:15,050
等人都到了以后  我就送你们进去
Once the entire party is here I will escort you in.

230
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,970
我可以保证  人都到了
The entire party is here, I assure you.

231
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,850
我们还在等州长
We're still waiting on the Governor.

232
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,770
怕不是在逗我
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

233
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:31,150
一大早就要摆点谱  是吗
Decided to start the day with a little theater, did you?

234
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:31,990
一点点
Just a little.

235
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,570
很高兴再次见到你
It's good to see you again.

236
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,490
-州长  -杰米
- Governor. - Jamie.

237
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,500
请坐
Please, have a seat.

238
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,620
我这里有咖啡  橙汁
There's coffee, some orange juice,

239
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,580
那边还有什锦糕点
and some assorted pastries over there

240
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,670
如果有人敢吃谷蛋白的话
for anyone willing to brave gluten.

241
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,300
我不怕谷蛋白
I, for one, am not afraid of gluten.

242
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:49,630
能给我弄一盘吗  再来点咖啡
Could you make me a plate, please, and some coffee?

243
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,590
我们就开门见山吧
Well, I say we just dive in.

244
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,470
海斯女士  你们愿意先开始吗
Mrs. Hayes, would your team like to start?

245
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,480
林务局的租赁合同已经拿到了
The forest service lease has been secured.

246
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:05,560
联邦航空局已经批准了机场和跑道计划
FAA has approved both the airport and runway plans.

247
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:07,440
航空公司已经同意提供资金
The airlines have agreed to finance the build

248
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,230
建造各自的航站楼
of their respective terminals.

249
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,530
零售商的租约也齐了
Our leases with retail vendors are in place,

250
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,910
这样我们就可以资助机场建设
which allows us to fund the airport build...

251
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:18,240
不需要州政府的资金  所以你选举需要公债的理由
...without using state funds, which negates your requirement

252
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,120
也就不成立了  因为我们不需要公债
to place the bond on the ballot, because we don't need the bond.

253
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,200
我们只要
We just need...

254
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,040
{\an8}匿名指控市场股票总裁工作场所骚扰

255
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,050
海斯女士  有什么问题吗
Mrs. Hayes, is there an issue?

256
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,340
有问题吗  威拉
Problem, Willa?

257
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,180
舒服了吧  贱人
Take that you fucking bitch.

258
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:39,060
埃利斯
Ellis?

259
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,480
我出去一下
I need to step out for a moment.

260
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,230
罗尔克有权就我们的立场发表意见
Roarke has the authority to speak on our position.

261
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:47,810
哪个是罗尔克
Roarke. Which one is he?

262
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,650
是我
That's me.

263
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,360
见过我以后  你就永远不会忘记了
Once you put a name to this face, you will never forget it.

264
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,700
嗯  我不会忘记的
No, I don't believe I will.

265
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:59,120
这给州政府带来了
Now... What this provides the state

266
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,200
机场  机票销售  租车  酒店税
is the added tax revenue from the airport, from ticket sales,

267
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,290
燃油销售增加的税收
car rentals, hotel taxes, fuel sales...

268
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,960
而且都是零投入
and all with zero investment.

269
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,920
这是一种永久性的可再生资源
It's a perpetually renewable resource

270
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,750
而且不需要州政府出一分钱
that doesn't cost the state one dime.

271
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,880
接下来就与你有关了  达顿先生
Which brings us to you, Mr. Dutton.

272
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,890
最适合机场建设的土地在这里
The land most suitable to the airport build... is this tract.

273
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,190
如果你想从黄石买地
If you're discussing purchasing land from the Yellowstone,

274
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,980
就得和我讨论一下
you will need to discuss it with me.

275
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,110
其实是和我讨论
Actually, you have to discuss it with me.

276
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,150
我有土地委托书
I have power of attorney over the estate.

277
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,690
前提是土地在犹他州
If the estate were in Utah.

278
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,990
你是在那里提交文件的
That's where you filed the documents.

279
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:38,070
蒙大拿州不承认
The State of Montana does not recognize

280
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,490
其他州签发的委托书
power of attorney issued by other states.

281
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,990
土地在蒙大拿州
The land is in Montana.

282
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
但她的委托书在犹他州
But her authority is in Utah.

283
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,870
如果她是律师  她肯定知道
I mean, if she was an attorney, she would know that.

284
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:52,210
现在看来  我是黄石的法律代表
As it stands, I am the legal authority representing the Yellowstone,

285
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,130
我同意出售那块土地
and I approve the sale of that tract.

286
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,590
想得美
The hell you will.

287
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,680
我同意  因为如果我不同意  土地委员会就会没收
Yes, I will, because if I don't, the Land Commission

288
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,930
你只能拿到土地价值十分之一的价格
will condemn it and you will get paid one tenth of what it's worth.

289
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,640
还要损失数百万的律师费
And you will also lose millions on attorneys

290
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,480
因为我无法代表牧场
because I cannot represent the ranch

291
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,190
同时还得没收它
and condemn it at the same time.

292
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:10,810
那就不要没收
Then don't condemn it.

293
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:14,020
这不是我的选择  这是她的选择
It's not my choice. It's her choice.

294
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,200
这是你的选择
It's your choice?

295
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,040
你会怎么选  莉奈儿
What do you choose, Lynelle?

296
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,210
没得选了  约翰
There is no choice anymore, John.

297
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,840
只剩选项了
There are only options.

298
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,050
我能看看环境影响报告吗
Could I see the environmental impact report?

299
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,350
林业局的报告就在你手上
The forest service report is in your packet.

300
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:44,970
不是林业局的报告
Not the forest service report.

301
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,520
鱼类及野生动物管理局
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife report on the impact

302
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,690
关于机场建在河边的影响报告
of an airport beside the river

303
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:53,860
毕竟那条河供养我们最古老的国家公园
that feeds our oldest national park.

304
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,180
一号跑道旁边的那条河
The one flowing beside runway one, right there.

305
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,360
这是我们诉讼的基础
That will be the basis of our lawsuit,

306
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,020
以防有人好奇
in case anyone was curious.

307
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,160
到时候我们会提出集体诉讼
It will be a class action suit

308
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,290
因为它会影响当地的土地和公园的土地
because it impacts native land and park land.

309
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:13,190
我们会跟大黄石联盟的律师碰头
We'll meet with attorneys from the Greater Yellowstone Coalition,

313
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,370
我们十年都没猎狼了
We stopped wolf hunting for a fucking decade.

314
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,620
你觉得我们会怎么处理机场呢
What do you think we're going to do to an airport?

315
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,880
我们不需要运气  法庭上见
We don't need luck. See you in court.

316
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,170
这也是你的角度  约翰
That's your angle, too, John.

317
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,680
这对你的土地有什么影响
How does this impact your land?

318
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,600
加入我们的诉讼  一分钱也用不花
Join our suit. It won't cost you a cent.

319
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,890
你不需要聘请律师
You won't have to hire an attorney.

320
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,770
我们会帮你聘的
We'll do it for you.

321
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,150
保留地曲线救国
A little curve ball from the Reservation.

{\an8}黄石牧场

323
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,620
那片土地是我的
That land is mine.

324
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,920
除了我  没人可以卖
And no one can sell it but me.

325
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:15,090
赶紧多说两句"那片土地是我的"
I'd say that as much as you can: "that land is mine".

326
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,380
说痛快了
Get it all out of your system.

327
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,850
宠物丢了吗  罗尔克
Lose your pets, Roarke?

328
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,330
你以为你赢了这场比赛
You think you're winning this game,

329
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,480
但你连规则都还不知道
you don't even know the goddamn rules.

330
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:38,030
别担心  我会教你的
But don't worry: I'm gonna teach them to you.

331
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,050
你不打招呼  也不说再见
You don't say hello, you don't say goodbye.

332
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,590
你没什么可说的吗  儿子
You got nothing to say to me, son?

333
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,380
他一直就没什么话可说  爸
He never has anything to say, Dad.

334
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:04,180
我有很多话要说  贝丝
Oh, I have plenty to say, Beth.

335
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,510
是吗
Oh, yeah?

336
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,720
那我洗耳恭听
Well, I'm all fucking ears.

337
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,190
不出所料
That's what I thought.

338
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,990
咱们就别跟他们客气了
Well, I'd say we pulled the band aid.

339
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,740
嗯  不过诉讼是个问题
Yeah. The, uh, lawsuits are a concern, though.

340
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,180
我们在他们的保留地铺设了一条管道
We put a pipeline through their reservation,

341
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,750
陆军工程兵团也参与了
and we did it with the Army Corps of Engineers.

342
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,210
俗话说大到不能倒
They talk about being too big to fail,

343
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,840
说的就是我们
they're talking about us.

344
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,130
州长  杰米  我走了
Governor. Jamie.

345
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,100
好吧
Well...

346
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,740
挺难受的吧
That must have been difficult.

347
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,740
也没有
Not really.

348
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,060
总有一天他会明白的
Well, one day he'll see.

349
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,670
他会知道你这么做是为了他
He's gonna know that you did this for him.

350
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,750
不  我不是
No, I didn't.

351
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,050
以后不是了
Not anymore.

352
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,090
从现在开始  我做的只是为了我自己
From now on, what I do is for me.

353
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,140
靠  我把发油落在旅行包里了
Oh, shit, I forgot my, uh, Show Sheen in my groom bag.

354
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,130
我去拿
I can grab it.

355
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,050
吉米  你康复了吗
Hey, Jimmy, you all healed up?

356
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,520

Yeah, we're getting there.

357
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,220
什么时候回来比赛
When you gonna be back on the circuit?

358
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,890
医生说我不能再骑烈马了
Doc said I'm not supposed to ride anymore.

359
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,450
吉米  医生跟我们所有人都说过
Shit, Jimmy. Doc has told us all that before.

360
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,190
你要退出牛仔竞技吗
Are you quitting rodeo?

361
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:38,920
达顿先生说我不应该
Mr. Dutton told me I'm not supposed--

362
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:42,340
达顿先生  就是给你打了烙印的
Mr. Dutton, he's the one who stuck you with that hot iron.

363
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,570
那个达顿先生吗
That Mr. Dutton?

364
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,700
我不想在轮椅上度过余生
I don't want to live the rest of my life in a wheelchair.

365
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,790
那就不要啊
Then don't.

366
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:52,460
即使你残了  过来  转身
Even if you do, come here. Turn around.

367
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,420
加油啊  安伯雷
Give it hell, Amberley.

368
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,960
那还用你说么
That's all I ever give it.

369
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:10,600
她腰部以下瘫痪了
She's paralyzed from the waist down,

370
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,280
但她赢我的次数
and she has whipped me more times

371
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,560
我已经数不清了
than I can remember.

372
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,830
你参加牛仔竞技时  我看到你非常开心
When I saw you rodeo, I saw a really happy man.

373
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,250
你愿意冒着生命危险去做爱做的事
I saw a man who risked his life to do what he loved.

374
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,380
然后我爱上了你
And I fell in love with him.

375
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,260
爷们点  你就可以拥有我
Be that man and you can have me.

376
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,010
像你现在这样嘛  到时候再说吧
But be this one, and I'll see ya later.

377
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,020
我很害怕
Hey, I'm scared.

378
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:58,190
我他妈
I'm fucking...

379
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,280
我他妈很害怕
I'm fucking scared.

380
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,820
谁不害怕呢
Who ain't scared?

381
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,880
我每次比赛都很害怕
Hell, I'm scared every time I run out there.

382
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,200
但我是牛仔  还是完赛了啊
but I cowboy the fuck up and I do it anyway.

383
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:14,160
如果你如此渴望追求归属感
If you're so desperate to belong to something,

384
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,660
那就做我的男人吧
then belong to me,

385
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:20,790
我们可以参加全国的牛仔竞技
and we can rodeo our way across this whole damn country.

386
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,420
这就是你的归属感
Belong to that.

387
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:27,340
但是不要成为有钱人的牲口
But don't be one of that rich man's cattle.

388
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,640
好的
Okay.

389
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,820
很好
Good.

390
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,620
去拿我的旅行包吧
Now go get my groom bag.

391
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,330
我离开的样子很性感吧
I look pretty good leaving, don't I?

392
00:29:58,890 --> 00:29:59,750
确实
Pretty good.

393
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,540
真的很性感
Naw, really good.

394
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,010
你有一个窗口
You have a window, you know.

395
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,760
什么窗口
A window to what?

396
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,180
在一个充满敌人的房间里  你看起来像他的朋友
In a room full of his enemies, you look like his friend.

397
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:18,140
但你不是他的朋友
But you're not his friend.

398
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,230
嗯  我不是
No, I'm not.

399
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,570
你有机会从他手上解救那片土地
You have an opportunity to free that land of him.

400
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,360
谁也看不出来是你干的
And it will look like everyone but you who did it.

401
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,280
我不是罪犯
I'm not a criminal.

402
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,990
这只是他们的法律
It's only a crime by their laws.

403
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:38,790
我们的法律超越了冰河时代  这是我们的责任
By our laws, which have outlasted an ice age, it is duty.

404
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,040
保护我们的土地和我们的生活方式
To protect our land and preserve our way of life.

405
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,040
这是信仰
It is religion.

406
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,770
难道你相信他们的信仰吗
Or did you buy into their religion

407
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:50,070
毕竟你接受了他们的法律
when you bought into their laws?

408
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:52,780
我会用他们的规则打败他们
I will beat them with their own rules.

409
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,100
规则就是用来打破的
They make their rules to be broken.

410
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,530
美国违反了自己制定的每一条规则
The United States has broken every rule it has ever made.

411
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:03,660
与法国的第一个条约  以及与我们的每一个条约
From its first treaty with France to every treaty with us,

412
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,980
与伊朗签订的最后一个条约
to their last treaty with Iran.

413
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,530
他们只要求别人遵守他们的规则
They only hold others to their rules.

414
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,910
他们想打就打  想打哪儿就打哪
They make war when they want, where they want,

415
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,620
想要什么就抢什么
they take what they want,

416
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,040
然后制定规则来阻止别人拿回去
then make rules that keep you from taking it back.

417
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,850
他们为奴隶制定规则
They make rules for the slave

418
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,630
也为主人制定规则
and they make rules for the masters.

419
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,340
你在遵守奴隶的规则
You're following the slave rules.

420
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,510
但如果你遵循主人的规则
But if you follow the masters' rules,

421
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,050
那你就会杀了他  夺回我们的土地
then you'll kill him, and give us our land back.

422
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,480
你和一个武士部落的人同行
You travel with a man from a warrior clan,

423
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,100
但你不让他发动战争
but you do not let him make war.

424
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:46,980
你让他也变成了奴隶
You make him a slave, too.

425
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,240
也许你已经听够了  做事不需要得到许可
Maybe you've heard enough that you don't ask permission.

426
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,120
也许你可以为我们的人民开战
Maybe you go and make war for our people.

427
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,000
然后我们就可以回家了
And then... we go home.

428
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,690
{\an8}蒙大拿畜牧协会

429
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,990
畜牧协会主席在你办公室
Chairmen of the Stockgrower's Association are in your office.

430
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:21,680
-哪一个  -所有人
- Which one? - All of them.

431
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,020
你们怎么样
How you boys doing?

432
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,960
有你在就更好了
Better, with you in office.

433
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,040
好吧  谢谢
Oh, well... Appreciate that.

434
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,160
不  是我们该谢谢你
No, we appreciate it.

435
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,990
我能帮什么忙吗
How can I help you?

436
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,050
我们在想  也许我们可以帮助你
Well, we're thinking maybe... maybe we can help you.

437
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,100
在这个过程中  也可以帮助我们自己
And help ourselves in the process.

438
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,020
州长只剩两年任期了
Governor's termed out. She's got two years left.

439
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,090
现在是决定谁接替她的时候了
Time to decide who replaces her is now.

440
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,130
我们想推荐你  凯斯
We're thinking that's... that's you, Kayce.

441
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,260
我们是认真的
Hey, we're serious.

442
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,830
我不是政客
I ain't no politician.

443
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,290
说的没错
You're damn right, you aren't.

444
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,770
你坦诚直白  言出必行
You say what you mean and you do what you say.

445
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:13,580
蒙大拿州又不一定认可我的正义观
I'm not sure my brand of justice is what this state wants.

446
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,500
这正是本州急需的品质
It's exactly what this state wants and needs.

447
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,910
有个混蛋偷你的牛
Some bastard goes and steals your cattle,

448
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,830
你没找治安官
you don't punt it to the sheriff,

449
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:24,470
而是直接去杀了那狗娘养的
you just go over there and shoot the son of a bitch.

450
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,760
这算什么竞选口号啊
I don't think that's much of a campaign slogan.

451
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,060
孩子  你可以在T恤上印个"我杀了一个偷牛贼"
Hell, son. You could print "I killed a cattle thief"

452
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,340
然后拿到教堂去卖
on t-shirts and sell 'em in church.

453
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,650
不行了  时代变了
Not anymore. Times have changed.

454
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:38,230
也许吧  但蒙大拿州没有变
Maybe so. But Montana hasn't.

455
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,550
博兹曼  米苏拉选不了州长
Bozeman, Missoula, they don't decide the Governor.

456
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,780
大瀑布城  迪伦  迈耳才能选
Great Falls decides. Dillon decides. Miles City decides.

457
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,870
那些嬉皮士肯定会抱怨和抗议
Those hippies will bitch and protest

458
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,330
然后发推说他们不还学校贷款了
and Twitter out bullshit about not paying off their school loans,

459
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,870
但他们投不了票
but they won't vote.

460
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,540
只要雪道上还有雪
They're not gonna stand in line and put their money

461
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,250
他们就没办法排队投票
where their mouth is when there's snow on the ski slopes.

462
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,950
他们五月举行选举  我们就玩完了
They start holding elections in May, we're fucked.

463
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:04,490
但在那之前  将由我们决定谁来管理这个州
But until then, we decide who runs this state.

464
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,080
凯斯  这需要时间
Kayce, these things take time.

465
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,670
是时候计划了  想想吧
Time to plan. Think about it.

466
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,940
当人们离开房间时  州长不用站起来
Governors don't have to stand when people leave the room.

467
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,090
坐着握手就好
You just sit there and shake hands.

468
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,600
保重
Take care.

469
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,380
董事会准备好了我们就开会
When the board is ready we'll conference in,

470
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,670
但你要向他们解释  这是一个恶作剧
but explain to them: this is a hatchet job.

471
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,500
举报人甚至都不是员工
Okay, the caller isn't even an employee.

472
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,380
你怎么知道  举报人是匿名的
How can you know that? The caller is anonymous.

473
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,930
她看着我的眼睛  亲口承认了
She looked me in the fucking eye and told me it was her!

474
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,830
应该雇佣她  而不是解雇她的
Should have hired her instead of firing her.

475
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,540
你能回避一下吗
Can you give us a minute?

476
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,040
好的
Okay.

477
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,230
你得玩阴的了
You need to start playing dirty.

478
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,610
我一直在玩阴的  然后他们阴了我们
I've been playing dirty. They play dirty right back.

479
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,820
他们在玩零和游戏
They are playing a zero sum game,

480
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,890
还拿我的事业做赌注
they're doing it with my fucking career.

481
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,400
这绝对不行
I will not have it.

482
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:07,860
这不像蒙大拿州的土地交易吧
Don't feel much like a land deal in Montana, does it?

483
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,490
嗯  感觉像也门的石油交易
No. It feels like an oil deal in Yemen.

484
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:13,150
从现在开始  我们就要这样对待
And from now on, that's how we treat it.

485
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,230
你可以吗
Can you do that?

486
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,690
你说什么就是什么
I can do whatever you want.

487
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,780
爆胎了吗
Got a flat?

488
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,180
是的  我想叫拖车
Yeah, I'm trying to call a tow truck,

489
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,910
但是没信号
but I don't have any signal.

490
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,890
你有备用的吗
You got a spare?

491
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,350
我不知道  这是租来的车
I don't know. It's a rental.

492
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,400
打开看看吧
Let's open her, find out.

493
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,950
猜猜我多大了
Guess how old I am.

494
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,950
八岁
Eight.

495
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,290
这不是我第一次猜了  孩子
Not my first rodeo, son.

496
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,630
看  所有的装备都在这里
Look. You got the whole kit right here.

497
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:41,050
我没有钱
I... I don't have any money.

498
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,680
我只是想说  我没有什么可以给你的
I'm just saying... I don't have anything to give you.

499
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,850
女士  你从哪里来
Ma'am, where are you from?

500
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,980
恩西诺  在加州
Encino. That's in California.

501
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,190
我知道恩西诺在哪里
I know where Encino is.

502
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,000
在这里  只要是对的事我们就会去做
Out here, we do things because they're the right thing to do

503
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,780
这是我们唯一的理由
and that's the only reason we need.

504
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,160
你想学生活技能吗
You wanna learn a life skill?

505
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:11,870
什么是生活技能
What's a life skill?

506
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,230
让你不用站在路边
It's something that'll keep you from standing

507
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,590
等手机信号的技能
on the side of the road hoping for a phone signal.

508
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,970
听起来很方便啊
Sounds handy.

509
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,800
以及如何
And how...

510
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,980
没想到这种事我还会帮你第二次
Never thought I'd have to do this for you again.

511
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,390
我也是
Yeah. Me neither.

512
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,870
她看起来有多糟糕  特里
How bad is she gonna look, Terry?

513
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,250
很难说
Well, it's hard to say.

514
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:39,440
要看防腐工行不行了
Depends on how good the embalmer was.

515
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,630
如果防腐得好  那
If he was good, then, uh,

516
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,590
她可能会看起来像我们埋葬她的时候
she might look like she did when we buried her.

517
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,700
但如果不好  那
But if he wasn't, then, uh...

518
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,790
可能会很糟糕
It could be bad.

519
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,420
希望是艾迪做的防腐处理
Let's just hope Eddie did the embalming.

520
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,180
嗯  是埃迪
Yeah. Yeah, it was Eddie.

521
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,120
妈妈
Hey, Mama.

522
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,420
我遇到了一个人
I met somebody.

523
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,390
我要和她共度余生
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with her.

524
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,580
我可以去商店
I could have gone to some store

525
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,870
给她买个傻逼戒指
and bought her some fucking ring,

526
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:57,400
但这有什么意思呢
but what does that mean?

527
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,110
妈的  对不起
Shit, I'm sorry.

528
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:01,480
不该说脏话的
Shouldn't curse.

529
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,120
我想让她戴你的戒指
I want her to wear yours.

530
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,010
你可以
Maybe you can, uh...

531
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,480
你也可以稍微了解一下她
Maybe you can know her a little too, somehow.

532
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,230
我不知道
I don't know...

533
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,650
我爱你  妈妈
I love you, Mama.

534
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,580
谢谢
Thank you.

535
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,090
来  过来
Come on. Come on.

536
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,720
过来
Come on around.

537
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,720
好了  好了
All right there, right there.

538
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,390
从马上摔下来  就再骑上去
You fall off the horse, you just get back on.

539
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,080
不喜欢吗
Don't like that, huh?

540
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,500
好好弓几次背  我就放了你
Just give me a couple good bucks and I'll let it loose.

541
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:45,630
来吧
Come on.

542
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,370
{\an8}舒瓦茨和梅耶

543
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,520
你想从供应室拿点什么吗
Do you want anything from the supply room?

544
00:41:22,540 --> 00:41:26,250
是的  我要笔  铅笔  纸
Uh, yes. I want the pens, the pencils, the paper,

545
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,050
咖啡  奶壶  都拿走
the coffee, the creamer... we're taking everything.

546
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,420
-我全都要  -已经确认威拉·海斯总裁
- I want it all. - ...has confirmed that CEO Willa Hayes

547
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,840
将被安排休假
will be placed on leave

548

直到独立调查结束
until after an independent investigation has been conducted.

549
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:38,430
海斯被指控为以下引述
Hayes was accused of what is being called and I quote,

550
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:40,100
"工作场所不当行为"
"workplace misconduct."

551
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:41,560
海斯小姐和她的律师
Miss Hayes and her lawyers were unavailable

552
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,940
不会对任何评论做出回应
for any type of comment...

553
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,130
这个放你车里吗
Do you want this in your car?

554
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:46,970
那不是我的
Oh, that's not mine.

555
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,090
是寄给你的
It's addressed to you.

556
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,850
奇怪  盒子里还有个盒子
Weird. A box within a box.

557
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:56,200
等等  我不知道那是什么
Wait, I don't know what that is.

558
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:56,980
不要
Don't--

559
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,500
我不是说我会参加竞选
I'm not saying I'm gonna do it,

560
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,210
我只是在跟你说他们说了什么
I was just telling you what they said.

561
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,500
过去三年你所做的一切
Everything you've been doing for the past three years

562
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:12,170
都是你说你不想做的事
is something you said you didn't want to do...

563
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,670
可你还是去做了
And now you just keep doing it.

564
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,640
好吧  那我不跟你说我的日常了
Fine, I just won't tell you what happens during my day

565
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,620
到时候秘密会越来越多
and the secrets can grow and grow.

566
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,170
凯斯
Kayce?

567
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,590
凯斯
Kayce!

568
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,260
好了
Alright, now.

把螺母给我
Go hand me them lug nuts.

570
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,430
我不知道去哪了
I don't know where they are.

571
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,770
伙计
Buddy.

572
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:40,890
这是你唯一的工作
That was your only job.

573
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,610
我小便时把它们放下了
I set them down when I pee'd.

574
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,030
这不是有线索了么  你在哪里小便的
Now we're getting somewhere. Where'd you do that?

575
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,280
好  去找找吧
All right. Go hunt 'em up.

576
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,660
谢谢你的帮助
Thank you for helping.

577
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,870
这是人们应该做的  不是吗
It's what people are supposed to do, isn't it?

578
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:02,330
但他们没有
But they don't.

579
00:43:07,850 --> 00:43:08,760
有些人是没有
Some don't.

580
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,600
不用了
No.

581
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:28,860
我们搞定了  谢谢你停车
We got it figured, thanks for stopping.

582
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:34,530
你是约翰·杜顿吧
Hey, you're John Dutton, aren't you?

583
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:36,370

Yep.

588
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,030
里普  你不应该再给我打电话了
Rip, I don't think you should call me anymore.

589
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:33,800
该死
Damn it, hey!

00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,760

00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,550
滚出去
Get the fuck out of here!

走开  走开
Go on! Hey! Go! Hey!

快滚  滚出去  混蛋
Go on, get the fuck out of here, you piece of shit.

595
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,950
该死
Goddamn.

596
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:04,790
我不喜欢朝马开枪
I hate shooting horses.

597
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:08,000
放松  放松
Easy, easy.

598
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,170
放松
Easy, boy.

599
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,690
我宁愿杀一千人也不愿意杀一匹马
I'd rather kill a thousand men than shoot another horse.

600
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:48,080
现在你们可以吃它了
Now you can fucking eat him!

601
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:11,270
今天整个山谷都死气沉沉的
Whole fucking valley's dying today.

602
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:46,100
意料之外  情理之中
Doesn't that fucking figure.
