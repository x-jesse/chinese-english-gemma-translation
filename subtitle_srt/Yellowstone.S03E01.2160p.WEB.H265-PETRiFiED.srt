这么大雨  看看有没有苜蓿冒出来
With all this rain, see if any of that clover came up.

10
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,940

别说了
Don't say it.

20
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,220
不用说
I don't have to.

21
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,630
我没什么好话可以说了
I can't say it any better than that.

22
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,870

It's okay.

明白  相信我
Understood. Trust me.

27
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:25,890
相信我
Trust me?

28
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,520
他会走进来
He's gonna walk in here--

29
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,830
不行
Okay, no.

30
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,180
你好  约翰
Hello, John.

31
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,780
莉奈儿
Lynelle.

32
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,630
我不知道从何说起
I, uh... I don't know where to start.

33
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,590
我知道
I know where to start.

34
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,690
我们有证据表明贝克兄弟用飞机
We had evidence that the Becks used aircraft

35
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,470
在埃米格兰南边89号公路旁边毒牛
to poison cattle along the highway 89 corridor south of Emigrant.

36
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,590
根据此信息发出逮捕令
Upon serving a warrant based on that information,

37
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,720
我们发现了绑架的证据
we discovered additional evidence of a kidnapping--

38
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,150
这些我们都知道  杰米
We know all this, Jamie.

39
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,190
畜牧协会探员有法律义务打击任何犯罪行为
Livestock agents are bound by law to intervene in any active crime.

40
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
职责高于管辖范围
That duty supersedes jurisdictional boundaries.

41
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,150
你要反抗吗  约翰
You gonna fight this, John?

42
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,520
我们说错了吗
Are we wrong?

43
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:18,410
你说的没错  但这并不会改变事情的角度
You're not wrong. But it doesn't alter the lens.

44
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,020
不会改变观察的途径和方式
It doesn't change the way it looks and how it looks--

45
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,720
这才是最重要的  约翰
Is all that matters anymore, John.

46
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,430
六个人死了
Six people died.

47
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:29,090
门关上了  约翰
The door is closed, John.

48
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,650
实话实说吧
Let's just be honest.

49
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,300
到时候毯子一拉开
When the blanket gets pulled back on this thing,

50
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,900
全国人民都知道
and the nation knows that the family member

51
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:36,640
被绑架的是你的
that was kidnapped was yours...

52
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,110
这就不像在执法
This stops looking like law enforcement

53
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,900
-而是  -世仇
- and starts looking like... - It looks like a feud.

54
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,820
看起来像是公报私仇
It looks like a gross misuse of power.

55
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,620
我们在这里想破脑袋
We have been sitting here banging our heads against a wall,

56
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,300
也没有想到解决办法
and we don't have a solution.

57
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,620
我有个办法  莉奈儿
I have a solution, Lynelle.

58
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:55,230
把毯子留在原处
You leave the blanket right where it is.

59
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,720
我辞去牲畜委员会委员
I'll resign as Livestock Commissioner

60
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,620
并为我的探员的过激行为负全责
and accept full responsibility for my agents' overreach.

61
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,270
你就不用盯着了
And you, you stop looking.

62
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,660
放手吧
You let it go.

63
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,160
你就说是民兵和人口走私
You talk about militias and human smuggling

64
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,590
功劳都归你
and you take the credit.

65
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,970
别把我和我的家人扯进来
And you leave me and my family out of it.

66
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,490
我觉得没问题
That cleans things up on my end.

67
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:32,500
这是州政府的事  就这么定了
This is a state issue and that's where I want it to stay.

68
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
你们不会插手了吗
And this keeps it a state issue?

69
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,850
是的  我得到了我想要的
It gives me what I need, yes.

70
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,790
很好
Great.

71
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,950
你想过接替的人吗
Have you thought about your replacement?

72
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,310
下周告诉你
Give me till next week.

73
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,390
谢谢你  约翰
Thank you, John.

74
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:53,810
我不会忘记的
I won't forget this.

75
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,820
我不会让你忘记的
I won't let you.

76
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:57,110
那肯定
I'm sure you won't.

77
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,280
牲畜委员会委员约翰·达顿和州长
There was a closed door meeting with the Governor,

78
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,480
检察长  联邦官员
the Attorney General, Federal Officials,

79
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,700
进行了一次秘密会议
and Livestock Commissioner John Dutton.

80
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,090
达顿办公室因为在多次枪战中使用暴力
Now, Dutton's office is under intense scrutiny

81
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:18,620
正在接受严格审查
for its use of force in multiple gun battles

82
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,750
你觉得他会有什么下场
How do you think this is gonna work out for him?

83
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,870
取决于他是否像我想的那么聪明
Depends, on whether he's as smart as I think he is.

84
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:30,620
我在外面观察过他
I watched him. In a field.

85
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,750
他有尊严  大多数人都没有
He had honor when most wouldn't.

86
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,890
你什么意思
What are you saying?

87
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,850
也许他不是我们想象中的敌人
I'm saying, maybe he's not the enemy we think he is.

88
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,280
当两个男人想要一样东西时
When there's one thing that two men want,

89
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,370
他们要么分享  要么是敌人
they can either share it or be enemies.

90
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,710
你是建议我们分享吗
Are you suggesting we share it?

91
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,180
建议不是我的工作  主席
Suggesting things isn't my job, Chairman.

92
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,170
而是你的工作
That's yours.

93
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,580
这边看起来还行
This side looks good.

94
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:22,260
这边也是
This side too.

95
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,950
把牛赶出去的感觉好吗
You feel good turning cattle back out?

96
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,830
上场雨下完  应该要长苜蓿的
It should have clovered up this last rain.

97
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,430
我觉得我们应该等到七月
I think we ought to wait until July.

98
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,310
我们没有干草了
We're running out of hay.

99
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,740
喂一夏天牛可不是谋生之道
Feeding cattle all summer is no way to make a living.

100
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,070
我靠  我们就跟以前一样
Shit, we'll just do it like the old days:

101
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,340
弄个流动炊事车
grab a chuck wagon, bring it out here

102
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,050
照顾它们一夏天
and we'll babysit 'em all summer long.

103
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:46,230
这主意其实还行
It's not the worst idea.

104
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,710
搞什么鬼
The fuck?

105
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,640
他们是谁
Who the fuck are they?

106
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,960
你们迷路了吗
Y'all lost?

107
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,820
有可能
It's a possibility.

108
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,220
这是天堂谷运动俱乐部吗
Is this part of the Paradise Valley Sporting Club?

109
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:14,910
在围栏的另一边
Wrong side of that fence.

110
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,190
我说吧
I told you.

他们是股东
They own it.

113
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,050

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,060
我的律所代表市场股票
My firm is representing Market Equities.

117
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,690
我们不懂这玩意
We don't know what that is.

118
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,120
他们管理度假村
They manage resort properties.

119
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,810
我们为他们的利益着想
We watch out for their interests.

120
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,900
这是你的土地吗
This your land?

121
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,370
不可思议
Incredible.

122
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,380
我还不知道你的名字呢
I didn't catch your name?

123
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,600
因为我没说
That's cause I didn't offer it.

124
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:55,540
也是
Fair enough.

125
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,970
我们马上就走
We'll get out of your way.

126
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,070
我能理解你的谨慎
You know, I can understand you being wary,

127
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,180
一群城里人在你的土地上瞎晃
bunch of city folks wandering in your field.

128
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,740
我道歉
I apologize.

129
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,840
来度假村吃晚饭吧  我们请客
Why don't you come by the resort and have dinner, on us?

130
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,710
毕竟  你们会成为邻居
After all, you're going to be neighbors,

131
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,580
以和为贵嘛
it's best if we all get along.

132
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:27,930

红色标注的地产是我们买的

厉害啊  贝丝
Good job, Beth.

138
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,780
不然你也不会雇我
It's what you pay me to do.

139
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,480
有商业用地吗
Any of it commercially zoned?

140
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,520
临近高速的地产大多是多功能的
Most of the highway frontage is multi-use.

141
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,930
边角的地产是商用的

143
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,940
我希望你可以暂缓保护地役权
I want you to hold off on the conservation easements.

144
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,050
那部分收入可以抵消我们的税收负担
That income offsets our tax liability.

145
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,510
我知道  但以后可能会有更多收入
I know, but there could be bigger income on the horizon.

146
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,740
市场股票买了詹金斯的地

雇了一个酒店管理团队来监督

148
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,040
动作很快啊
That was fast.

149
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,320
詹金斯别无选择
The estate didn't have a choice.

150
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,240
他每月损失六位数呢
He was losing six figures a month.

151
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,040
银行本来都要让他抵押了
Bank was going to call the note.

152
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:17,380
现在是谁在管理这处地产
So, who is running the property now?

153
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:20,520
普罗维登斯
Providence.

154
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,710

00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,760
当你的目标是扩张时  就会把他们牵扯进来
It's the one you bring in when your goal is expansion.

156
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,790
你的扩张范围并不仅限于赌场和高尔夫球场
And your expansion is bigger than casinos and golf courses.

157
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,900
你听说他们的计划了吗
You heard any rumors about their plans?

158
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,180
可能和他们在奥斯汀和斯科茨代尔的计划一样

贝丝  继续买入

160
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,070

Buy every fucking thing you can get your hands on.

161
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,770
好的
Will do.

162
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,290
旧马厩怎么了
What's wrong with the old barn?

163
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,350
那里离农场这半边有七英里呢
It's seven miles from this half of the ranch.

164

167
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,950
那不是笑话  杰克
That wasn't a joke, Jake.

168
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:10,240
那是你在库珀家的糗事
That was you at the Cooper branding.

169
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,140
你们想听个笑话吗
You guys wanna hear a joke?

170
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,110
不想
No.

171
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,460
听着
All right, check it out.

172
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,410
有个得州石油大亨
There's this big Texas oil guy, right?

173
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,010
走进边境的一家酒吧
Goes into this bar down at the border,

174
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,420
坐在牧人旁边说
sits next to this vaquero and says,

175
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,260
"哥们  你是牧场主吗"
"Hey, man, you a rancher?"

176
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,450
牧人说"嗯  我在河边有50英亩地"
Vaquero says, "Yeah, I got fifty acres down by the river."

177
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,940
得州石油大亨说"在我的农场
Big Texas oil guy says, "Oh? Oh, on my ranch,

178
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,940
我早上坐上我的卡车
I can get in my truck in the morning,

179
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:32,760
日落前都到不了大门"
and I still don't reach the front gate by sunset."

180
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,780
牧人坐了一会儿  点头说
Vaquero sits for a second, nods, and says,

181
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,000
"是啊  伙计  我以前也有一辆那样的卡车"
"Yeah, man. Yeah, I used to have a truck like that too."

182
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,090
我
I...

183
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,800
他在吹嘘他的牧场有多大
He was bragging about the size of his ranch,

184
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,500
-牧人以为  -我差点就笑了
- and the vaquero... - That was almost funny.

185
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,570
我想到一个
All right, I got one.

186
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,570
有个人去看医生
Y'all hear about the guy that goes to see a doctor,

187
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:54,290
医生说"很遗憾告诉你

188
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,820
但你从头到脚都有癌症
But you got cancer head to toe.

189
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,500
只剩一周可活了"
Only have one week to live."

190
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,700
他说"一周  那可不够啊
Man says, "A week?! Well, that's not enough time!

191
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,850
医生  你得做点什么
Doc, you gotta do something.

192
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,040
一周可不够"
I need more than a week!"

193
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,880
医生想了想  坐下说
And the Doc thinks, he sits down and he says,

194
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,510
"你这样吧

195
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,750
你去找个养两只狗的绕桶赛女孩
You go find yourself a barrel racer girl

196
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,370
然后把她给娶了"
with two little dogs, and you marry her."

197
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,350
那个人说"这样就能活得更久吗"
And the man says, "That's gonna make me live longer?"

198
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,580
医生说"不是
And the Doc says, "No.

199
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:19,740
但你这周肯定度日如年"
But it'll make that week feel like a fucking eternity."

200
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,260
我觉得我的更好笑

201
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,910

你应该开个"资助我"的页面

我男友把他的头按进墙里

他们不会继续惹麻烦了
They don't get any bigger.

235
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,260
别告诉老爸  可以

不行  那是非法入侵
I can't That would be trespassing.

243
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,570
这傻逼
This fucking guy...

244
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,520
我发现这个山谷里的女人越来越时髦了
I see the women in this valley have gotten a lot more fashionable.

00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,400
我发现齐本德尔改变了假牙政策

算了
Never mind.

250
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,250
骂人也得让给人听懂啊
Only an insult if I understand it.

251
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,510
其实不用
Yeah, that's not true.

252
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,830
但是这话下次再说吧
But that's a conversation for another time.

253
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,400
其实根本没有下次了
That we'll never have.

254
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,400
河的两岸都是私人领地
Both sides of the river are private property.

255

嗯  可是那在上游五英里啊

I was blessed with stamina.

261
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,630
我深表怀疑
I highly doubt it.

262

我打高尔夫  一天能打36个洞
When I played golf, I'd do 36 holes in a day.

263
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,230
我更喜欢这样
I like this much better.

264
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,340
这很像高尔夫  不过把球换成了鱼
It's just like golf, but with fish.

265

00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,510
我不是特指今晚
I meant in general.

268
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:25,230
不用  我以快乐为生
No. I dine on my joy for life.

269
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,530
离我们的地盘远点  好吗
Just stay off our fucking land, okay?

270

271
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,930
我会离你的地盘远点
I'll stay off your fucking land.

272
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:33,950

你还是好好琢磨一下吧
You should analyze that.

276
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,620
怎么样
How'd it go?

277
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,800
如我所料
Like I expected.

278
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,530
这对他们来说是笔好交易
It's a good trade for them.

279
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,020
他们很高兴
They were happy to make it.

280
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,320
你呢  你高兴吗
How bout you? You happy?

281
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,950
我压根就不想当官  贝丝
I never wanted that office, Beth.

282
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:21,310
我只是  喜欢掌控大局
I just... wanted the control.

283
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,310
现在控制权依然在我手里
I still have that.

284
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,740
这好像有点难以信服
This might be a tougher sell.

285
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,440
这不是还好有你嘛
Well, lucky I got you to sell it for me.

286
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,480
草场怎么样
How are the fields?

287
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,760
很绿
They're green.

288
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:45,350
没有苜蓿吗
No clover?

289
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,710
我没看到  不过草长得很高
None that I could see. Grass is tall, though.

290
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,650
我在想我们应该建个营地
I was thinking we should run a camp up there

291
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,850
继续盯着
and keep an eye on 'em.

292
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,630
天堂谷那边有情况
Oh, and there's something going down at Paradise Valley.

293

有一堆西装革履的人
There's a bunch of suits

294
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,450
在那里闲逛
wandering around up there when we got up there.

295
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,800
西装
Suits?

296
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,130

297
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,940

我要任命一个新人接替我的职位
I need to name my replacement as Commissioner.

299
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,860
我决定任命你
I'm naming you.

300
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,440
你现在才告诉我吗
You mean you're just gonna tell me this now?

301
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:23,540
辞职以后再告诉我
After you already quit?

302
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,490
如果我之前告诉你  你肯定会拒绝
If I told you before, you'd say no.

303
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,830
-那我就辞不了了  -我还是不同意
- Then I couldn't quit. - Well, I'm still saying no.

304
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,070
-凯斯  -我不是政客

306
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,270
你面前就站着一个
You've got one standing right there.

307
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,300
工棚里还有一个
You got another one in the bunkhouse

308
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,550
-跟孤儿似的  -凯斯
- living like a fucking orphan. - Kayce--

309
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,990
我说了我会帮你经营这里
I told you I would help you run this place,

310
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,160
但我只知道现在这一种方式
and I'm doing that the only way I know how.

311
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,360
我不同意
I won't do it.

312
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,730
我能提个建议吗
Can I make a suggestion?

313
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,150
嗯  只要你愿意接替我
Yeah, as long as it's you.

314
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,910
我不行
Can't be me.

315
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,270
我必须找个家里人去任职  贝丝
I need family in that office, Beth.

316
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,380
那不是还有一个人呢
You can have family in that office.

317
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,090
我不信任他
I can't trust him.

318
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,740
他的所作所为证明了我的看法
All he does is prove it.

319
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,250
他就是这样的人
You can trust him to be exactly what he is.

320
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:20,320
杰米只会为自己着想  爸
Jamie will always do what is best for himself, Dad.

321
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,520
他会利用这个职位来讨选民的欢心
And he will use the office to become popular with his constituents.

322
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,630
他的选民都是农场主
His constituents are ranchers.

323
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,980
对他们的农场有利  就对我们也有利
What's good for their ranches is good for ours.

324
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,750
快走
Go, go!

325
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,890
快跑  快跑
Run, run, run, run!

326
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,260
快  快  快
Go, go, go!

327
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:59,360
-我靠  -我操
- Oh, shit. - Goddamn.

328
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:01,720
这是你第一次套到我
First time you ever got me.

329
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,300
吉米
Jimmy.

330
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,070
好吧  好吧  来吧
Okay, okay, okay, okay, come on.

331
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,780
你现在靠骑烈马为生
You get bucked off shit for a living now.

332
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,480
这对你来说小菜一碟
This'll be a piece of cake for you.

333
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,280
而且考虑到
Take into consideration that

334
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,790
要有脑子才能得脑震荡
you got to have a brain in order to get it concussed,

335
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,920
你肯定没事的
so, you'll be all right.

336
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,540
哥们  别套我的鸡巴啊
Hey, bro, just try not to rope my dick.

337
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,250
不然你妈肯定会很生气
or your mom's gonna be really pissed.

338
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,130
-把绳子给我  -这个我笑了
- Gimme the fucking rope. - That's funny.

339
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,950
开始吧
Okay, here we go.

340
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,450
-好  -开始数
- Okay. - On the clock.

341
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,810
一  二
One, two...

342
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,570
-别往心里去  -三
- It's not personal, it's not personal. - Three!

343
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,480
跳
Jump!

344
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,690
这就是报应  贱人
That's what we call karma, bitch.

345
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,770
报应
Karma.

346
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,260
你妈肯定会很生气
Your mom's gonna be really pissed.

347
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,720
帅哥  到你了
Hey, pretty boy, you're up.

348
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,490
我就算了
Uh, no, I'm good.

349
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,600
算了
You're good?

350
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,070
-是的  -什么
- Yeah. - What?

351
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,830
他不想玩就算了
He don't gotta if he don't want to.

352
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:54,040
不  杰米  你也得恪尽职守
No, no, Jamie, you gotta pay your dues, bro.

353
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,210
好吧
Yep.

354
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,740
走起  搞起来
Rally, let's rally, let's rally.

355
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,730
-来吧  -怎么玩
- Here we go. - So how does it work?

356
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,740
-对着Y转圈  -对着Y
- Spin on the Y. - Yep, on the Y.

357
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,650
好的
Okay.

358
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,920
这里吗
Here?

359
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:09,700
好
Okay.

360
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,010
不  这个
No, this.

361
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,000
-这就对了  -我靠
- There he is. - Bro, damn.

362
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,750
对嘛
There he is.

363
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,350
说说你的感受  让我们看看你的感受
Tell us how you feel! Show us how you feel!

364
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,100
好吧  我不太明白为啥要玩这个
Okay, okay, I don't really understand the purpose of this,

365
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:30,980
但是来吧
but let's do it.

366
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,890
开始吧  数到三  对吧
Let's do it! On three, right?

367
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,520
走起
Take off coming!

368
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,950
我靠
Shit!

369
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,590
你干什么呢
What are you doing?

370
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,810
我想套在他腰上  就不会摔那么重了
I tried to lay it on his waist so he wouldn't go down hard.

371
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,340
你没套上啊
Yeah, well, you sure fucked that up.

372
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,040
他还好吗
Is he all right?

373
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,860
你还好吗
Are you good?

374
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,150
什么时候轮到我套
When is it my turn with the rope?

375
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,920
你们在干什么
What the fuck are you doing?

376
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,530
怎么还没睡
And why are you still awake?

377
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,630
怎么  很晚了吗
What, is it late?

378
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,410
吉米  现在凌晨三点半了
Jimmy, it's 3:30 in the morning.

379
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,900
弄块表  好吗
Get a fucking watch, will you?

380
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,210
-你还好吗  -嗯
- You okay? - Yeah.

381
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,870
小心这些白痴
Be careful with these idiots.

382
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,100
他们没什么脑子
Ain't a brain cell between the bunch of them.

383
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,750
一个小时后就要给整个马厩上鞍了
In one fucking hour you have to saddle the whole barn.

384
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,520
我们明早要配对
We're pushing pairs in the morning.

385
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,390
也就是说到时候要把帐篷搭好
And that means I want wall tents set up

386
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,250
流动炊事车收拾好
and I want that chuck wagon up fucking wind

387
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,260
不然你们就跟灰熊一起睡吧
or you'll be sleeping with the goddamn grizzlies.

388
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,320
你
And you...

389
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,350
你应该管好这些白痴
You're supposed to keep a cap on these morons.

390
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:41,220
成熟点  好吗  罗伊德
Act your fucking age, would you, Lloyd?

391
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,010
莫妮卡
Monica?

392
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,450
没事吧
Is everything all right?

393
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,810
-嗯  -泰特还好吗
- Yeah. - Tate okay?

394
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,480
凯斯和他在一起
Kayce's with him.

395
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,600
医生给了我们开一些助眠的药  但我
Doctor gave us some pills to help him sleep, but I just...

396
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,840
不相信药  知道吗
Don't trust pills, you know?

397
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:30,770
是啊  我也是
Yeah. Me either.

398
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,690
总之  我只是
Anyway, I'm just...

399
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,960
我在找上楼的路
I'm trying to find my way upstairs.

400
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,530
我懂  厨房一左转
Yeah, I know... You make a left turn out of that kitchen

401
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:41,210
就进入迷宫了
and you're in a damn maze.

402
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,390
可不是嘛
Ain't that the truth.

403
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,300
莫妮卡  我一直没机会说声对不起
You know, Monica, I never got to say I'm sorry.

404
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,360
我只是让他去喂个马
I just sent him down there to feed his horse.

405
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,130
想让他担点责任
Trying to give him some responsibility,

406
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,090
虽然这不关我的事  但我应该和你打个招呼的
not that it's my place, but I should've asked.

407
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,270
他被抓走并不是你的错
It's not your fault that they took him.

408
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,420
你能把他带回来  我真是感激不尽
And I can't thank you enough for bringing him back.

409
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,530
这是大家的功劳
Well, we all got him back.

410
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,180
凯斯以前总跟我说保住这个地方
Kayce used to tell me what a war it was for you,

411
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,530
对你来说是一场战争
keeping this place.

412
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:20,080
150年前  这片土地属于我的人民时
When this land belonged to my people a hundred and fifty years ago,

413
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,230
孩子被偷  男人被杀
children were stolen and men were killed.

414
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,540
家人像牲畜一样被赶了出去
Families herded away like cattle.

415
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,920
什么都没变
And nothing's changed.

416
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,350
但现在印第安人变成你了
Except you're the Indian now.

417
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:37,710
也许吧
Maybe so.

418
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,240
凯斯说
Um, Kayce said that

419
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,760
你要在牛群附近建营地
you're building a camp near the cattle.

420
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,380
是啊  我也没办法
Yeah. Don't have much choice.

421
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,750
有人想杀牛或者偷牛
Or someone will try to kill or steal them, too.

422
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,170
能帮我个忙吗
Will you do me a favor?

423
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,090
尽管说
Anything.

424
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,450
你能带上泰特吗
Would you take Tate with you?

425
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,680
抬头就能看见星星应该是最有效的药了
I can't think of a better medicine than stars for a ceiling.

426
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,960
你可以帮我吗
Would you do that for me?

427
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,790
当然
Of course.

428
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,780
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Good night.

429
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,410
莫妮卡
Monica?

430
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,960
楼梯在那边
Stairs are back there.

431
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,240
谢谢
Thanks.

432
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,220
好吧  坐副驾啊
All right, coming shotgun there, huh?

433
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,180
把马送回马厩
Stick that horse back in the barn.

434
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,910
把你的装备从工棚拿出来
Move your gear out of the bunkhouse.

435
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,040
拿到哪
Move it where?

436
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,810
屋子里
The lodge.

437
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:22,770
为什么
Why?

438
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,550
因为我不能让牲畜委员会委员住在工棚
'Cause I can't have the Livestock Commissioner living in the bunkhouse.

439
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,780
我明天会正式任命
I'll make the appointment official tomorrow.

440
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,200
如果你再背叛我
And if you betray me again,

441
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,480
我就当没你这个儿子  明白吗
you are dead to me, son. You understand?

442
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,280
明白  谢谢
Yes, sir. Thank you.

443
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,970
爸
Dad.

444
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:49,310
我不会背叛你的
I won't betray you.

445
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,820
我保证
You have my word.

446
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,620
迟早会知道你说话算不算话
Well, we're about to find out what that's worth.

447
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,400
凯斯  你和里普领着牧人赶牛
Kayce, you and Rip take the wranglers, start pushing the herd.

448
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,810
我们跟着你们
We'll be right behind.

449
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,120
走吧
All right, let's go.

450
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,200
看好他
Keep an eye on him.

451
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,260
你知道我会的
You know I will.

452
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
我
I'm, uh...

453
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,720
委员会的事很抱歉
I'm sorry about the Commission.

454
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,490
但我干不来
It's just not me.

455
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,770
你是我儿子
You're my son.

456
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,320
我很了解你
I know exactly who you are.

457
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,110
永远也不要为此道歉
And don't you ever be sorry for it.

458
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,570
准备好了  老大
We're ready here, boss.

459
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,000
世上没有比这里更美的景色了

你跑过去看看
Why don't you run up there,

472

能不能最后再捡点柴火

474

州法院在这里没有管辖权

475
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,130
-让他们滚  -这不是州法院签发的

法庭可以废除任何提议或暗示的协议

485
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,310
你是说我听不懂你说话吗

492
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:08,040
我以为在室外上一天课
I thought moving the class outside for a day

493
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,280
能让你们放下手机
would get you off your phones,

494
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:12,160
但你们还是盯着各自的小屏幕
but you're still staring at your tiny screens.

495

给素未谋面的人的照片点赞
liking photos of people you've never met

497

你们知道你们生活的世界发生了什么吗
Do you have any idea what is happening in the world you live in?

498
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,160
你们觉得屏幕上的照片
Do you think that the photo on your screen

499
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,570
和这个的世界有关联吗
has anything to do with that world?

500
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,750
你们生活的世界正在慢慢缩小
The world you live in is slowly shrinking.

501
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,400
有一小撮男人把你们的世界买了下来

505
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,400
你们却像羊一样排队等着
and you line up for it like sheep.

506
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,260
他们会杀害你们的兄弟  偷走你们的孩子
They will kill your brother and steal your child

507
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,260
污染你们所爱的一切
and pollute everything you love.

508
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:59,490
你们根本注意不到
And you'll never notice because you're so hypnotized

509
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,280
因为你们被一个不存在的世界催眠了
by a world that doesn't exist.

510
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,100
好吧
Well...

511
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,980
真是浪费我的时间
What a waste of my fucking time.

512
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,060
房子就像船
You know, houses are like boats:

513
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,940
它们需要洗礼
they need to be Christened.

514
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,320
我也这么想过
Well, the thought's crossed my mind.

我再给你倒一杯
Let me pour you another.

519
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,670
不用了  我就要那个  过来  亲爱的

别担心那只狼  妈妈们

他回不来
Not coming back.

524

他今晚要守着牛群
He's with the herd tonight.

525
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:30,780
他的活算简单的
He got the easy job.

526
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:40,940
你去哪
Where are you going?

527
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,610
没事的
You're all right.

528
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,660
没事的
You're all right.

529
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,520
那只狼  独自在外面游荡
So, that wolf, he's out there walking around by himself,

530
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,960
呼唤它的朋友
calling out to his friends

531
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,940
这样朋友就知道它在哪了
so they always know where he is.

532
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,850
因为他害怕吗
Cause he's scared?

533
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:09,400
不  狼不会害怕  它们的基因里没有害怕
No. Wolves don't get scared. It's not in their genes.

534
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,810
它们会感到疲倦
They get weary.

535
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,600
也很聪明
They get smart.

536
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,130
就像人一样
Like people.

537
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,050
是啊  像某些人吧

538
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,980
我会做噩梦
I have nightmares.

539

想聊聊吗
Wanna talk about 'em?

540

嗯
Well...

541
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,350
我在一个房间里
I'm in that room.

542
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,120
地板就这么消失了
The floor just disappears...

543
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,260
我摔下去了
And I fall.

544
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,320
一直下降
Keep falling.

545
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,190
我在尖叫
I scream.

546
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,530
但是没有声音
No sound comes out.

547
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,100
没人听得到  所以没人来救我
No one hears me, so no one comes to help me.

548
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,460
你知道梦是什么吗
Know what dreams are?

549
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:15,560
梦是你的记忆和想象力
It's your memories and your imagination

550
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,930
混在一碗
all mixed together in... into this soup

551
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:22,730
半真半假的汤里
of what's real and what's made up.

552
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,250
但这碗汤吧
But the thing about this soup is:

553
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:30,250
你可以改变配料  泰特
you can change the ingredients, Tate.

554
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,940
你想放什么都行
You can put in whatever you want to.

555
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,660
任何记忆  任何幻想
Any memory, any fantasy.

556
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,210
你可以成为棒球明星
You can... You can be a baseball star

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,640
整天拆圣诞礼物
who opens Christmas presents all day long.

558
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,500
这样等你闭上眼睛
So, when you close your eyes later...

559
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,500
就可以定制自己的梦
decide what you're gonna dream.

560
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,330
特定的梦
And that'll be the dream.

561
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,740
你做过噩梦吗
Have you ever had a nightmare?

562
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,420
我做过一个
I have this one...

563
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,550
我在路上开着车
Where I'm driving down the road

564
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,440
有几个人停车了
and there's these people pulled over.

565
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,380
我停车去帮忙  但是
I pull over to help, but...

566
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:29,980
他们不需要帮助
They don't want help.

567
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,340
他们想要别的东西
They want something else.

568
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:38,910
他们想要什么
What do they want?

569
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,410
无所谓了
Doesn't matter.

570
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,900
因为你换了配料
'Cause you changed the ingredients.

571
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,810
没错  我换了配料
That's right, I changed the ingredients.

572
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,480
这样就不会成真了
So now it won't come true.

573
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,970
这样就不会成真了
Now it won't come true.
