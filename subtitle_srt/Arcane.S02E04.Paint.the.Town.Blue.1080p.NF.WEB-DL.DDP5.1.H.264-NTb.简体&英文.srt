1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,120
? Oh, you want a villain? Let me show you how I evil ?

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,040
? Oh, you think I'm difficult? I'll show you all my devil ?

3
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,950
? Sharpshooter, lethal 'Cause I'm a messy, feminine diesel ?

4
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:32,000
? Wow ?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,790
? Paint the town blue Riots all around you ?

6
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,450
? Paint the town blue Riots all around you ?

7
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,790
? Riot ?

8
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,790
(金克丝 皮尔特沃夫 通缉)

9
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,120
? Paint the town blue Riots all around you ?

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,830
? Crush, crush, crush Crush you all beneath me ?

11
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,660
? You bitches are my pups You're droolin' for a squeaky ?

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,250
? I skewer all you said Now the battlefield is greasy ?

13
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,910
? Dig my nails into your peach You know, 'cause we are not amici ?

14
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,120
? Paint the town blue Riots all around you ?

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,120
(蓝色)

16
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,830
(金克丝)

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,370
? Paint the town blue Riots all around you ?

18
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:27,160
? Riot ?

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,330
(金克丝 皮尔特沃夫 通缉)
? Paint the town blue Riots all around you ?

20
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,620
(蓝色狂潮)

21
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,540
? I wake up to the sounds Of the silence that allows ?

22
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,830
? For my mind to run around With my ear up to the ground ?

23
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:59,750
? I'm searching to behold The stories that are told ?

24
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,330
? When my back is to the world That was smiling when I turned ?

25
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,830
? Tell you you're the greatest ?

26
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:15,790
? But once you turn, they hate us ?

27
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,790
? Oh, the misery ?

28
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,910
? Everybody wants to be my enemy ?

29
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,450
? Oh, spare the sympathy ?

30
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,370
? Everybody wants to be my enemy ?

31
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:32,910
? Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way ?

32
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,500
? My enemy ?

33
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,120
? Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint ?

34
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,410
? Look out for yourself ?

35
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,410
《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第四集

36
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,410
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

37
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,500
又醒了
Up again?

38
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,370
你多睡一会儿也不会怎么样
The city's not going anywhere.

39
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,450
我明天一早安排了去见石匠工会的人
I have an audience with the Masons' Guild first thing in the morning.

40
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,660
我猜又是来告诺克萨斯的状的
Let me guess. Complaints about the Noxians.

41
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,290
诺军要求我们修建的 防御工事又翻倍了
They doubled their fortification requests. Again.

42
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,660
- 说是... -“为了保护我们”
- To keep-- - Keep us safe.

43
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:18,330
我没想到这件事会持续这么久
I never expected this to go on so long.

44
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:20,620
我以为...
I thought...

45
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,660
我说不清楚
I don't know what I thought.

46
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,910
反正不是现在这样
Just... it wasn't this.

47
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,750
你可以直接叫停
You could call it off.

48
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,450
让他们从底城撤兵
Withdraw from the underground.

49
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,080
你可以重组议会
Reestablish the Council.

50
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,660
只要你一声令下就行
All you have to do is give the order.

51
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,450
那得先抓住金克丝
Not without Jinx.

52
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,450
而且撤了兵情况 也不见得会好转 毕竟...
Besides, a withdrawal could lead to a worse situation than the one--

53
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,700
还有安蓓萨
Okay, Ambessa.

54
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,200
她帮我们拿下了底城 她说到做到
She delivered us Zaun, as she vowed.

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,660
没有她 不知道还要赔上多少执法官的性命
Without her, who knows how many Enforcers we'd have lost?

56
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:03,000
我从她身上学到了不少
I've learned so much from her.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,830
你才是我们的头
You're our leader.

58
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:06,950
全体执法官 皮城的所有人
The Enforcers, Piltover,

59
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,370
大家只追随你
they follow you.

60
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,040
我也只追随你
I follow you.

61
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,160
你先去睡吧
I'll come to bed soon.

62
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,000
好男 好女 好朋友们
Ladies and gentlemen,

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
这儿可不是你们该来的地儿
you're in the wrong place.

64
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,200
恶棍 无赖 街溜子们
Scumbags and scalawags,

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,080
把你们的狗爪子 铁爪子都拍起来
put your hooks and paws together

66
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,700
最无耻 最下作 最血腥的决斗马上开始
for the meanest, ugliest, goriest spectacle of your lives.

67
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:46,330
擂台这边的是我们的常胜将军
In the gray corner, our undefeated champion.

68
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,120
他的利爪所向披靡
With claws like daggers

69
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,200
一口尖牙更是锋利无比
and teeth like sharper daggers.

70
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,120
他是恶贯满盈 谁见谁怕的臭臭嘴
The devilish, the wretched Stink Maw!

71
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,830
在擂台另外一边的是挑战者
And in the other gray corner, the challenger.

72
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,950
他是角斗界的新秀
A rising star,

73
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,370
他青面獠牙
with hideous mandibles

74
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,540
那副模样连育母蜘蛛看了都无地自容
and a face that would make a brood mother squirm.

75
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,950
他就是丑中之王
The creepy,

76
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,080
尖牙利齿怪
the dastardly Scuttle Butt!

77
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,200
两兽即将登场
Two will enter.

78
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,620
究竟谁输谁赢 比过才知道
And after that, who knows?

79
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,080
驯兽人 放你们的猛兽出来吧
Handlers, release your beasts.

80
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,120
不 你这是怎么搞的
No, no. What are you doing?

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,660
倒是卖卖力气啊
Show some effort.

82
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,870
恭喜你 这把你赢了
Congratulations on your victory.

83
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,870
好吧 看来常胜将军也不常胜
Well, you're past your prime, champ.

84
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,120
那岂不是只能...
Only thing to do is--

85
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,540
再比上一场 来个东山再起
A rematch? Return of the titans.

86
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,660
复仇吧 救赎吧
Vengeance. Redemption.

87
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,620
赶紧再放点臭气吧
The inexplicable release

88
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,330
别再藏着掖着了
of bodily gases.

89
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,160
(金克丝)

90
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,200
好吧 好吧
All right, all right.

91
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,750
虽然我不认为这是什么好点子
I still think it's a dumb idea.

92
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,410
不过谁叫你赢了呢
But I guess you won,

93
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:30,580
只好愿赌服输了 就依你的
and a deal's a deal. I guess.

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
喜欢吗
You like it?

95
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,500
算你走运
You're lucky.

96
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,910
我老姐在我小时候 可从没给我搞过这些
I didn't get to do much of this with my older sis.

97
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,370
她成天想的都是打打杀杀
She was more into... hitting things.

98
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,750
那会儿我还不叫金克丝
I had a different name back then, you know.

99
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:01,790
那时候叫爆爆
Powder.

100
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,910
是不是挺傻的
Stupid, right?

101
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:06,870
还以为我早就把那傻大姐给忘了
I thought I was rid of her for good, but, uh...

102
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,370
可你又让我想起了她
you kind of remind me of her.

103
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,500
是塞薇卡教你这么干的
Did Sevika put you up to this?

104
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,500
我已经洗手不干了 小鬼
That's a past life, kid.

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,790
都是些陈芝麻烂谷子的事了
And it was about as sweet as last year's milk.

106
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,330
金克丝早就死了
Jinx is dead.

107
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,540
是谁说这皮城里 到处都是聪明绝顶的发明家
How, in a city teeming with brilliant inventors,

108
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,910
怎么我们费了半天劲找来的
have we managed to unearth such

109
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,910
全是这种不顶用的废物
unrelenting incompetence?

110
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,580
是他们在搞鬼
This is their doing.

111
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,330
还不确定是不是黑色玫瑰...
We can't be certain the Black--

112
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,000
不许再跟我提这个名字
Keep their name out of your mouth.

113
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,080
我们还不确定 令杰斯和黑默丁格失踪的幕后黑手
We can't be certain the Order was also behind the disappearance

114
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,540
是教团还是另有其人
of Jayce and Heimerdinger.

115
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,660
还能是谁
Who else?

116
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,750
这座城市一到我们手里 就变成了一潭死水
The moment we seize control of this backwater,

117
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,410
但凡有点本事的人全都没影了
everyone with an inkling of talent vanishes.

118
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:10,750
哪有这么巧的事
It's no coincidence.

119
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,500
我们的直觉是对的
Our instincts were right.

120
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,660
他们畏惧海克斯科技
They fear Hextech.

121
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,790
可惜晚了一步
But we were too slow.

122
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,540
怎么就没想到先摁住那帮科学家呢
How could I not secure the scientists?

123
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,870
我女儿在他们手上 雷克托斯
They have my daughter, Rictus.

124
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,540
有机会出手的
Our moment will come.

125
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,290
但您必须做好准备
But you must be prepared.

126
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,120
为了提高效率 加快进程
To expedite processing,

127
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,250
请将您的所有箱包提前打开 等待检查
have any and all bags open and ready for examination.

128
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,160
快走

129
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,620
快点 跟上

130
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,410
我们将尽一切努力保证 皮尔特沃夫的安全
Officers ask for your cooperation and compliance

131
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,700
同时我们的官员也希望您能够
as we make every attempt

132
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,120
配合我们的工作
to ensure the safety

133
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,910
- 服从安排 - 下一个 快点走
- and security of Piltover. - Next. Move along.

134
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,410
重复一遍 为了提高效率...
To expedite processing...

135
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,700
要恨就恨金克丝
You have Jinx to thank for this.

136
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,290
她不是你们的朋友
She is not your friend.

137
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:20,450
也不是你们的英雄
She is not your champion.

138
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,580
她躲起来 留你们在这儿受罪
She hides while you suffer.

139
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,790
就这样的人 你们还不把她交出来
And yet you refuse to hand her over.

140
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,540
服从安排
...the safety of all citizens...

141
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,790
各类枪支弹药严禁携带入内

142
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,120
快走
Let's go.

143
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,160
金克丝
Jinx.

144
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,120
你说对了
You're right.

145
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,950
像她的东西化成灰我都认得出来
It's hers. I'd recognize it anywhere.

146
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,040
可除了这个都不像她
That's where the similarities end.

147
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,330
没弄出人命 也没故弄玄虚
No body count. No theatrics.

148
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,450
是不是有人故意模仿她
You think it's a copycat?

149
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,870
像是被我们逼急了 在乱抓救命稻草
I think we've made them desperate for something to believe in.

150
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,620
这点骚动不影响我们早上说的那些话
This doesn't have to change what we talked about this morning.

151
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,370
- 你还是... - 诺伦执法官
- You can still-- - Officer Nolen.

152
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,330
最近来得还挺勤啊
Quite the familiar face these days.

153
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,290
将军
General.

154
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,750
我有事找吉拉曼恩指挥官谈
I'd like a word with Commander Kiramman.

155
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,450
单独谈
In private.

156
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,410
我想不需要我来提醒你
I suppose I don't need to advise you

157
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,250
公私不分会带来什么不良影响吧
on the hazards of professional entanglements.

158
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,540
我想你来找我 应该也不是为了这个吧
Nor is that the advice you rushed here to provide.

159
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,330
虽说得知了金克丝现身的消息
It's beyond question that the news of Jinx's return

160
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,950
底城人又会重燃反抗之心
will ignite Zaunite resistance.

161
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,950
可凡事有坏处 必有好处
But the blade cuts both ways.

162
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,540
她的行踪我们已有了线索
There's a trail. We have her scent.

163
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,500
我还以为这样的进展能激起你的斗志
I'd expected this development would encourage you.

164
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,250
你的手下雷克托斯挑起争端
Was it for my encouragement that your man Rictus

165
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,000
也是为了激起我的斗志吗
was instigating violence?

166
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,540
你信不过我
You don't trust me.

167
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,620
凡事有好处 必有坏处
"The blade cuts both ways."

168
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,370
真是年少无畏
Fearless child.

169
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,000
你很敢说呀
You never shy.

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,290
那你有什么高见吗
You have a recommendation?

171
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,000
大闹检查站的就算不是金克丝本人
If it wasn't Jinx at the checkpoint,

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,200
也是知道她下落的人
one of them knows where she is.

173
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,290
逮捕是需要正当理由的
Arrests require cause.

174
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:51,330
让这座城市恢复和平
What greater cause is there

175
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,660
还有比这更正当的理由吗
than returning peace to this city?

176
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:58,000
为什么总要打着 和平的旗号动用武力呢
Why is peace always the justification for violence?

177
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,040
我们已经失去了太多
We've lost so many.

178
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,620
面对愤怒 面对悲痛
The anger, the sorrow...

179
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,830
快要承受不住 精疲力尽了
It's tiring. Gods, I know it's tiring.

180
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,000
但是她一天不落网
But you will never rest knowing

181
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,910
我们就一刻不得安宁
that she's out there.

182
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,540
或许是我小瞧了你
Or maybe I underestimated you.

183
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,660
或许你身上有我不具备的东西
Maybe you have the strength I do not.

184
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,700
对过去释怀
To forgive

185
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:38,200
对未来充满信心
and trust in tomorrow.

186
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,660
如何抉择由您定夺 指挥官
The decision is yours, commander.

187
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,580
想当年 我办的宴会是城里数一数二的
I hosted the most lavish galas in the city.

188
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,910
能成为我的座上宾 可是人们身份的象征
It was a measure of status to be on my guest list.

189
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,080
那时我多风光
Toast of the town.

190
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,120
可是现在人们躲我就像躲瘟疫一样
Now people avert their gaze when I roll by.

191
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,660
我可从来没有躲过您
My gaze isn't averted.

192
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,700
得了吧
Oh, spare me.

193
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,500
谁不知道你那张嘴跟抹了蜜似的
I wouldn't have hired you

194
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,750
就会讨好客人
if you weren't versed

195
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,950
不然我也不会雇你了
in the art of indulging your clients' egos.

196
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,330
你也算是议会硕果仅存的 元老级成员了
Plus you're one of the few councilors left from the old batch, right?

197
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:22,910
米达尔达家的少主 一点儿音信也没有 不是吗
Never learned anything about the younger Medarda, did they?

198
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,330
她人都没影了 怎么还是大家关注的焦点
Even when she's not here, she's all anyone talks about.

199
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,370
我明白
I get it.

200
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:30,450
毕竟她是米达尔达家族最后的继承者
She's the last heir of the great Medardas.

201
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,330
可是福是祸 人各有命
But the writing's on the wall.

202
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,870
都失踪那么久了
When you're missing this long,

203
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:35,750
怕是回不来了
you're not coming back.

204
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,500
下周还是老时间
Same time next week?

205
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,700
就明天吧
Tomorrow.

206
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,700
药效已经越来越弱了
The effects have been diminishing.

207
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,910
最近一直听人提起 说裂沟有个治疗师
I keep hearing about this healer down in the fissures,

208
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,700
住在荒郊野外
way out on the fringes.

209
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,500
都说他有起死回生的本领
They say he makes miracles happen.

210
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,330
我见过一次 可以说算得上是奇迹了
I saw one. Like nothing I'd ever seen before.

211
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,290
去见见也无妨 对吗
Can't hurt to look, can it?

212
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,500
你也应该提前说一声
You could have warned me.

213
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,160
想得倒挺美 有什么可说的
Fat chance. About what?

214
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,830
你在检查站搞的那出
Your stunt at the checkpoint.

215
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,200
听不懂你在胡说八道什么
No idea what you're babbling about.

216
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,620
难道不是你吗
That wasn't you?

217
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,410
反正不管怎么样
Well, however it happened,

218
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,290
现在整个底城都传遍了 说你回来了
the whole undercity's buzzing, saying you're back.

219
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,330
- 所以我才想... - 劝你还是别想
- So I'm thinking-- - Not your strong suit.

220
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,910
说不定会有转机
Would make a world of difference

221
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,870
要是你能站出来 当这个带头的
if you showed up. You're a symbol.

222
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,660
我当带头的
Ha. You want a symbol?

223
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,540
希尔科他这一辈子 一直在努力让底城团结起来
Silco spent his whole life trying to rally the undercity together.

224
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,870
谁想到老天开了个玩笑
Stupid joke that it is,

225
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,830
把办成这事的机会给了你
you have the chance to pull it off.

226
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,370
我说过了 我对这事没什么兴趣
I told you, I'm not interested.

227
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,620
你知道希尔科为了保护你
Do you know how much he sacrificed

228
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,250
付出多大代价吗
to protect you?

229
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,700
他始终相信 你是个好苗子
He believed in your potential.

230
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,160
那他就不该死
Well, then he shouldn't have died!

231
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,160
我今晚召集了大家
We're having a rally tonight.

232
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,000
在范德尔的雕像那儿
Vander's statue.

233
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,330
野火帮的人
Firelights,

234
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,540
拥护你的人
your fans...

235
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,040
能叫上的我全都叫上了
Anyone I can bring to the table.

236
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,290
你想在这里当缩头乌龟也行
Stick your head in the dirt if you want,

237
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,450
不过别以为蹲在这儿就能自己骗自己
but this fantasy you've been living out here,

238
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,620
你也是时候该醒醒了
it's not gonna last forever.

239
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:31,790
出门别绊着自己
Don't trip on the way out.

240
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,750
这你都能受得了 小鬼
I don't know how you do it, kid.

241
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,330
我得去找个人烦烦了
I gotta go bother someone.

242
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,580
还是老样子 不理我 是吧
Still giving me the silent treatment, huh?

243
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,200
在你和伊莎面前
Between you and Isha,

244
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,330
我都不知道怎么耍贫嘴了
I'm losing my snappy comebacks.

245
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,700
我当英雄
Me, a hero.

246
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,330
这地方真的是要完蛋了
How screwed up is this place?

247
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,370
我知道塞薇卡说得对
I know Sevika's right,

248
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,040
而且或许这是我欠你的
and I probably owe it to you,

249
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,080
都是因为我闯下的那个大祸
on account of the murdering and all.

250
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,790
不过我现在有别的事情想做
But I got something going now.

251
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,410
我交到了朋友
A friend.

252
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,290
我想好好对她
And I don't want to mess it up.

253
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,250
就像你当年对我那样
Maybe that's what I was like for you.

254
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,950
你要是这么想让我帮忙
If you care so much about me

255
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,080
玩你那个改变世界的破游戏
playing your stupid revolution game,

256
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,540
就赶紧吭一声
speak up now,

257
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,790
不然我就...
or I guess...

258
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,500
我就当你真的不在了
I guess you... You're really gone.

259
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,370
那么我也没有理由再待在这里了
And there's no reason to stay here anymore.

260
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,250
雕像
Statue...

261
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,790
范德尔的雕像
Vander's statue...

262
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,540
大家以前确实有些恩怨
It's no secret we got history.

263
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,540
各帮各派都没少流血
Blood spilt on all sides.

264
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,660
可咱们在同一片土地上长大
But we grew up on the same streets.

265
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,790
吃过同一碗剩饭
Ate the same scraps.

266
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,830
不管你们怎么想
Like it or not,

267
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,450
我们现在都在同一条船上
we're in this mess together.

268
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,120
执法官抄了咱们的家
Enforcers raiding our homes.

269
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,540
诺克萨斯人把刀架在咱们的脖子上
Noxians down our throats.

270
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,160
许多人平白无故地被丢进大牢
Innocents getting carted off to Stillwater.

271
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,750
今天必须做个抉择
We gotta choose right now

272
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,250
大伙究竟是想认输
whether we're gonna throw in the towel

273
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,750
还是想团结一致 奋起反抗
or make a stand together.

274
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,620
不管你是野火帮的 站金克丝的
Not as Firelights or Jinxers

275
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,500
还是没了靠山的残兵
or washed-up goons.

276
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,370
- 你都是底城人 - 我们要见金克丝
- As Zaunites. - We wanna see Jinx!

277
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,660
- 我们要见金克丝 - 她在哪里
- Where is Jinx? - Where is she?

278
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,410
我们要见她
We wanna see Jinx!

279
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,830
金克丝在哪儿

280
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,290
- 快说 她在哪儿  - 她在哪儿
- Yeah, where is she? - Yeah, where's Jinx?

281
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:40,290
我们要见金克丝

282
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,500
原地抱头 原地站好

283
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,290
你们全都被捕了
You're all under arrest.

284
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,120
放下武器 放下
- Drop the blade. - Drop it.

285
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,410
放下你的武器
Drop the blade.

286
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
我回来啦
I'm back.

287
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,500
上次不算 今天咱们再比一次
Time to find out who's the new pebbleweight--

288
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,620
伊莎
Isha?

289
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,790
好吧 我懂了
Okay, I get it.

290
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:51,250
跟我玩捉迷藏是吧
We're playing that game, are we?

291
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,200
伊莎
Isha?

292
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,410
她被抓走了
They got her.

293
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,450
什么
What?

294
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,790
她去参加集会了
She came to the rally.

295
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,120
上城的人搞了个突袭
Topside raided the place.

296
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,790
所有人都被抓了
Took everyone.

297
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,500
金克丝 你知道你自己是谁
You know what you are.

298
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,700
够了 闭嘴 闭嘴
- Damn it, Powder! - Shut up. Shut up.

299
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,160
闭嘴
Shut up. Shut up.

300
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,450
别这么叫我 我现在叫金克丝
Stop calling me that.

301
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:23,500
- 她的名字叫金克丝 - 她是我妹妹
- Her name is Jinx. - She's my sister.

302
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,330
金克丝 你得去找到她
- Jinx. - You have to be someone else.

303
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:28,250
- 金克丝 - 别再藏了
- Jinx. - Jinx.

304
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,580
振作点 小家伙
Chin up, little one.

305
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,290
我跟你说个秘密
I'll tell you a secret.

306
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,000
我们不会待太久
We won't be staying long.

307
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,540
你这胳膊游不动泳吧
Don't suppose you can swim, huh,

308
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,290
左撇子
Lefty?

309
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,040
好吧 那就只能玩点花的了
Well, only leaves the fun option.

310
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,500
我已经开始后悔了

你们一闭眼就做上的噩梦
The author of your nightmares.

再邀功领赏 当大英雄去
Claim the prize? Be the big hero?

我裤子招谁惹谁了
What's wrong with my pants?

323
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,250
裹着马戏团的破帐篷就上街了
You look like a half-eaten circus tent.

我让她自己选是上这儿来
I gave her a choice between this

331
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,700
还是把她扔水里游会儿泳
