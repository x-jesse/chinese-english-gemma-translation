1
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,620
享受这一刻吧 梅尔·米达尔达
Drink the moment, Mel Medarda.

2
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,750
第一次的感受是最特别的
There is no time like your first.

3
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,790
我是你们的一员
I'm one of you?

4
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,540
是法师
A mage?

5
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,240
我们所能施展法术的方式各有不同
We each have our own expressions.

6
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:39,200
你的尤为罕见
Yours is quite rare.

7
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,330
是一种潜移默化的心灵之术
An empath. Attuned to the ethereal.

8
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,330
可以感知他人的潜意识 并反射他人的法术
Able to sense others' inner selves and bend their magic.

9
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:49,290
既是媒介 也是镜子
A conduit and a mirror.

10
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,870
那么你又是什么
What does that make you?

11
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,040
始终藏在幻术之后 不肯以真面目示人
Even now you hide your true face behind illusions.

12
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,540
真相不过是一种极致的幻术
Truth is the greatest illusion of them all.

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,200
依我看 面具背后是你的恐惧
I think beneath that mask you're scared.

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,410
我能识破你的花招 这对你构成了威胁
I can see through your tricks. That makes me a threat.

15
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,580
天赋异禀之人往往会受制于自负
For the gifted, arrogance is the ultimate threat.

16
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,500
你的能力固然珍贵
Your power has merit.

17
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,490
但想要取你性命
But should one want you dead,

18
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,830
也只需一把利刃而已
a simple blade would do nicely.

19
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,660
我哥哥他在哪儿
Where is my brother?

20
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:25,120
真的很遗憾 在他的事上 你母亲没有说谎
Regrettably, his fate wasn't among your mother's lies.

21
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,950
你杀了他
You killed him.

22
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,540
我给过安蓓萨无数次 为僭越行为赎罪的机会
I gave Ambessa every opportunity to atone for her transgressions.

23
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,200
可她选择了自傲 而非子嗣
She chose pride over progeny.

24
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,580
但你不必背负她的罪责
But you need not bear her crimes.

25
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,490
这场考验 这整个的迷局
The test. This whole charade.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,830
一切只为让我加入你们
You want to recruit me.

27
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,950
你的能力在快速成长
Your talents developed quickly.

28
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,450
这并不是巧合 是奥术正在觉醒
It's no coincidence. The Arcane is waking up.

29
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,080
我母亲到底干了什么
What has my mother done?

30
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,700
一场浩劫在所难免
A calamity is approaching,

31
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,410
规模堪比曾经的符文战争
rivaling even the ancient Rune Wars.

32
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,490
安蓓萨是此事的主导
Ambessa sits at the helm,

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,290
她对权力已经迷恋到无法自拔
blinded by her thirst for legacy.

34
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,080
我们试图改变她 但都无济于事
Our efforts to divert her course have foundered.

35
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,370
我们承受不起再一次失败了
We can't afford another failure.

36
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,700
所以你才看中了我 拿我当致命一击
This is what you see in me? A silver bullet?

37
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,080
你能带来救赎
I see salvation of your city,

38
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,080
拯救你的城邦 以及数以万计的生灵
countless others beyond.

39
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,490
她是我的母亲
She's my mother.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,200
即便犯下种种错误
For all her faults,

41
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,250
那也是因为她想尽力维护我们的家族
she has always done what she thought was best for the family.

42
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,830
当初你哥哥也这么认为
Your brother thought so too,

43
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,660
直到他发现了她的秘密
until he uncovered her secret.

44
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,870
你的降生
Your birth,

45
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,580
和你整个人生从来都不是一场意外
the entire course of your life, was no accident.

46
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,330
她将你隐姓埋名 只因你是她求之不得的
She hid you because you are that which she covets most:

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,040
利器
a weapon.

48
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,830
如今 你因为加入我们而得到重生
Today you've been born into a new family,

49
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,950
很快你会意识到 曾经的家再也回不去了
from which you'll find there is sadly no return.

50
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:57,000
那些从未接触过奥术的人害怕我们
Those untouched by the Arcane fear us.

51
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,620
这是什么
What is this?

52
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,580
见面礼 愿你未来顺遂
A welcome to your future.

53
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,950
独行的法师将要面对的世界凶险万分
The world is a perilous place for a solitary mage...

54
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,950
姐妹
sister.

55
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,330
{\an8}《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第八集

56
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:39,330
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

57
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,450
很抱歉 没能救活他
I regret that I couldn't save him.

58
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:37,870
他的伤势实在太重了
His injuries were too severe.

59
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:42,290
我们不会为死去的战士哀悼
We do not lament a warrior's death.

60
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,330
我们只会为他复仇
We avenge it.

61
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,080
他们的先驱怎么样了
What of their Herald?

62
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,240
血清能帮助维克托再维持一段时间
The blood should sustain Viktor for a short while.

63
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,410
接下来就全凭他自己了
Beyond that, it is up to his own will.

64
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,620
你曾承诺能使人起死回生
You promised a cure to death.

65
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,290
那取决于维克托是否能挺过来
An outcome dependent on Viktor's survival.

66
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,160
博士
Doctor.

67
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,910
你的才干应当受到嘉奖
Your ingenuity deserves praise.

68
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,830
维克托
Viktor.

69
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,450
我心怀感激
I am... grateful.

70
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,830
我眼中的世界如今变得
The world I now see is more...

71
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,910
更加的通透了
lucid than ever.

72
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,000
你的意识能进入你的追随者
You can inhabit your followers?

73
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,410
我们是一体的
We are one.

74
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,660
这个叫作光荣进化
This is the Glorious Evolution.

75
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,290
本来可以这样的
Or it could have been.

76
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:59,330
但我知道我时日不多了
I sense my twilight approaching.

77
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,080
在海克斯飞门底部 有一个异常点正在恶变
An anomaly festers beneath the Hexgates.

78
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,950
我相信它能够帮助博士实现起死回生
I believe it has the capacity to complete the doctor's transformation.

79
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,580
那它能帮你实现为他人进化吗
This will allow you to evolve others?

80
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,370
理论上能
In theory.

81
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,200
但杰斯的攻击收效显著
But Jayce's attack has done its work.

82
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,700
现在的我
I do 

83
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,660
面对他们可能的防守 已经有些无力招架了
not have the strength to overcome the defense he will raise against me.

84
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,620
我派人护送你去异常点
I will deliver you to this anomaly,

85
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,000
但你要先为我的这些士兵 实现一次强化
if you agree to empower every soldier I bring you.

86
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,120
我将为所有有此意愿的人实现进化
I will evolve all those willing.

87
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,750
蔚
Vi?

88
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,620
蔚
Vi?

89
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,330
蔚
Vi?

90
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,580
快点 得赶紧离开这里
Come on. We need to get out of here.

91
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,790
不 伊莎
No! Isha!

92
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,700
瞧瞧你
Shh. Easy there.

93
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,580
找了三个大夫才救回你的小命
Took all the three docs to patch you up.

94
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,040
洛里斯
Loris?

95
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,410
不知道你能不能扛过来
Wasn't sure you'd pull through.

96
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,120
得亏你脑袋够硬
Thank that thick noggin of yours.

97
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,790
其他人在哪儿
Where are the others?

98
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,410
凯特琳呢 金克丝呢
Cait? Jinx?

99
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,080
金克丝她...
Jinx.

100
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,370
凯特琳本想陪在这儿亲自告诉你
Caitlyn wanted to be here to tell you herself.

101
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,410
洛里斯
Loris.

102
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,250
你就说吧
Spit it out.

103
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,240
或许我们还是有得谈的
Maybe we can negotiate.

104
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,700
和安蓓萨没得谈
Not with Ambessa.

105
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,950
她的眼神已经告诉我
I saw it in her eyes.

106
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,870
她要让整个皮尔特沃夫 为我的背叛付出代价
She will burn Piltover to the ground for my betrayal.

107
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,330
你不用过分自责
You can't blame yourself.

108
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,490
我不需要你的安慰
I don't need consolation.

109
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,040
我需要应对计划
I need a plan.

110
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,200
抓起来了
Arrested?

111
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,410
这边我能处理 麦迪
I can handle this, Maddie.

112
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,370
你去看看我父亲吧
Check on my father?

113
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,490
蔚
Vi. 

114
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,910
她救了你的命
She saved your life.

115
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,120
你能不能先冷静一下听我说
If you will calm down for one...

116
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,330
即便她明知道你不会对她手下留情
Knowing you'd never have done the same for her.

117
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,120
你怎么知道我不会
We'll never know, will we?

118
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,290
你根本就没给我机会 参与你那部分的计划
You didn't let me in on that part of your plan.

119
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,700
幸亏没让你参与
Clearly the right call,

120
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,160
你从来就没有信任过她 没准儿还想把她给塞进棺材里
since you still can't trust her enough not to shove her in a box.

121
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
信任
Trust?

122
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
你当我是个傻瓜吗 她出手救我就是个巧合
You believe I'm so daft I can't recognize a contingency?

123
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,740
她在那儿不是为了保护我
She wasn't there for my benefit. 

124
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,240
而是为了盯着我 因为你不信我会按照你的计划行事
You didn't trust me to follow through.

125
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,450
这能怪我吗
Can you blame me?

126
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,700
是谁不声不响地搭上了 那个自私狡猾的战争狂
How long were you sidled up with that shifty, self-serving war pig?

127
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,700
她给你灌了什么迷魂汤 你对她那么言听计从
She oinked poison in your ear. You just ate it.

128
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,870
我心里有数
I know.

129
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,790
金克丝当时唯一的要求 就是把你带到安全的地方
The only thing Jinx cared about was getting you to safety.

130
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,370
然后她就投降了
Then she just surrendered.

131
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,040
我还没来得及想对策 她就被那些人拖走了
I didn't even have time to think before they hauled her off.

132
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,870
她现在被关在地牢里 我还...
She's being held in the bunker while 

133
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,700
我还没想好怎么办
I decide what to do.

134
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,250
我想先等你醒过来
I was waiting for you to recover.

135
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,870
凯特琳 她和以前不一样了
Cait, she's changed.

136
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,540
没人能抹去曾经犯下的错 谁也不能
We can't erase our mistakes. None of us.

137
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,200
谁规定我们不能有再来一次的机会
Who decides who gets a second chance?

138
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,580
如果你是来杀我的 麻烦利索点儿
If you're here to kill me, make sure to finish the job.

139
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,410
蔚觉得你和以前不一样了
Vi thinks you've changed.

140
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,040
她就是个死脑筋 咱俩都清楚
She can't accept what you and I know.

141
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:49,040
根本不会有什么大团圆结局
There are no happy endings.

142
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,160
不想再为自己说点什么吗
Is that all you have to say for yourself?

143
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:55,990
不会有审判的
There won't be a trial.

144
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,080
但我想给你一次机会 听听你对曾经犯下的罪过
I'm giving you this one chance to account for your actions,

145
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
和造成的伤痛做何解释
all the pain you've caused.

146
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,250
做再多善事也无法洗清曾经犯下的罪
No amount of good deeds can undo our crimes.

147
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,500
你要干什么就快动手吧
Do what you came here to do.

148
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,500
恨你的同时
Hating you...

149
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,290
我也在恨我自己
I've hated myself.

150
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,370
我已经快要撑不下去了
I just don't have the energy for it any longer.

151
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,450
我不知道你妈妈当时也在那里
I didn't know your mom was there.

152
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,120
虽然这也并不能改变什么 但我那时
It probably wouldn't have made a difference, but...

153
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,790
的确不知道
I didn't know.

154
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
杰斯
Jayce?

155
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,500
你这是怎么了
What happened to you?

156
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,870
我不要紧的
Doesn't matter.

157
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,080
我也遇到了些事情
Something happened to me too.

158
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,330
那次袭击你我幸免于难 全是因为你
You're the reason we didn't die in the attack.

159
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,660
看来的确如此
Apparently so.

160
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,620
这事你知道多久了
How long have you known?

161
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:14,000
从那天开始 我就有种说不清楚的感觉
It started then. Feelings I couldn't explain.

162
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,080
但这个
But this...

163
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,700
至今我也无法完全理解
I still don't fully understand.

164
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,790
为什么只救我 为什么不救其他人
Why just me? Why not save all of them?

165
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,490
那不是我能决定的
It wasn't a decision. 

166
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,330
前一秒你还在议会上发言
One moment you're addressing the Council,

167
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,120
下一秒我们就站在废墟里了
the next we're standing in rubble. 

168
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,790
我完全不知道我自己做过些什么
I didn't have any greater awareness.

169
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,990
我怎么知道你到底有没有在撒谎呢
How can I know you aren't lying to me?

170
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,740
你为什么会觉得我在撒谎
Why would you think I am?

171
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,040
因为你利用了我 还有维克托 为了海克斯科技
Because you used me, and Viktor, for Hextech.

172
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,830
你把我们两个当成是投资
You called us "investments."

173
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,990
两个绝顶聪明的青年发明家
Two brilliant young inventors who shared a penchant 

174
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,580
都致力于创造奇迹
for impossible surprises.

175
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,410
将魔法从神秘的传说变成现实的应用
Carrying magic from myth to machine.

176
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:50,410
承载着希望 鼓舞了人心
Rallying the hope and hearts of a nation.

177
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,950
你俩确实是一种明智的投资
You were a wise investment.

178
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,580
请给你我一点和平相处的时间 杰斯
Allow us a moment of civility, Jayce.

179
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,830
我们必须谈谈
We must talk.

180
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,700
维克托
Viktor.

181
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
你是怎么进到这儿的
How did you get in here?

182
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,450
你当年能站在这里 我也是有贡献的
You once benefitted from my knowledge of this place.

183
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,490
那是很久以前的事了
That was a long time ago.

184
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,660
如果你愿意给我机会
Had you given me the chance,

185
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,830
我就能向你展示我的成就
I would have shown you the merits of my work.

186
00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:32,990
我们的成就
Our work.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,700
不 是你自己执迷不悟
No, this is your obsession.

188
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,370
你对那些人所做的一切 都是你的一意孤行
Everything you've done to these people, you did alone.

189
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,450
或许吧
Perhaps.

190
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:49,580
但我不再是孤身一人
But I'm alone no longer.

191
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:52,700
现在他们每个人都时刻与我同在
I now speak with all their voices.

192
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,740
有什么话你就直说吧
Say what you came here to say.

193
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,040
我觉得吧 你其实已经明白
Somehow I think you already understand

194
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,200
该怎么做才能完成我的使命
what must transpire to complete my mission.

195
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:04,580
我希望通过和平的方式实现
I would prefer to do so in peace.

196
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,950
但诺克萨斯人有别的想法
The Noxian has other intentions.

197
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,370
我母亲
Mother?

198
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:20,120
奥术在你体内涌动
The Arcane stirs within you.

199
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,160
维克托 为了大家好 请你离海克斯飞门远点
Viktor, for all our sakes, stay away from the Hexgates.

200
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,790
你变得固守陈规了 杰斯
Your mind has become rigid, Jayce.

201
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,410
恐惧影响了你的判断
Fear clouds your judgment.

202
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,950
这一连串事件因你而起
This chain of events started with you.

203
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:58,870
我苦思冥想 却怎么也想不通
In my confusion, I was unable to reconcile this.

204
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,950
但现在我终于明白
But I now understand.

205
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,370
一切终将会走向光荣进化
The Glorious Evolution is destined.

206
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,290
让我们就像过去那样再做一次搭档吧
Let us instead do this once again as partners.

207
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,540
我的搭档已经死在这里了
My partner died in this room.

208
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,290
我曾尽我所能去避免如今的局面
It was my sincere desire to avoid this.

209
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,200
博士
Doctor.

210
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,040
你现在可以开始了
You may begin the process.

211
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,750
走开
Go away.

212
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,240
你来得太迟了
You're too late.

213
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,540
这地方真够可以的
Oh, it's a hell of a place.

214
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,990
倒是能说明马可斯的为人
It says something about the late Marcus

215
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,040
他居然说把你姐姐关起来比杀了她...
that he found imprisoning your sister to be a greater mercy 

216
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,330
更加仁慈
than killing her.

217
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,290
杀人可不仁慈
Killing isn't mercy.

218
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:46,750
看来这副皮囊下的 叛逆之火还没有熄灭呀
A spark of rebellion still burns inside that husk, I see.

219
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,700
没错 杀人偿命 循环往复
No. Killing is a cycle.

220
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,700
远在范德尔和我之前就有了
One that started long before Vander and me.

221
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,120
你们俩之后也不会停止
And it will continue long after the two of you.

222
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,410
可我已经受够原地打转了
I'm done running in circles.

223
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,990
我们为自己画地成牢
We build our own prisons.

224
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,120
用誓言 规则和承诺铸成围栏
Bars forged of oaths, codes, commitments.

225
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,750
用自我怀疑与认知局限建起高墙
Walls of self-doubt and accepted limitation.

226
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,200
我们困在这些自我设限的身份牢笼中
We inhabit these cells, these identities,

227
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,660
还美其名曰“这就是我”
and call them "us."

228
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:26,040
我曾经以为干掉那些所谓的 狱卒便可以挣脱牢笼
I thought I could break free by eliminating those I deemed my jailors.

229
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,160
但是
But...

230
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
金克丝
Jinx...

231
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,040
只有下定决心 放下离开 才能终结循环
I think the cycle only ends when you find the will to walk away.

232
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,500
金克丝
Jinx?

233
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,870
你来干什么
What are you doing?

234
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,790
我从守卫那里顺来了钥匙
I swiped these from the guard station.

235
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,200
如果你肯帮我们
If you come, help, 

236
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,290
把你那一身发明炸弹的本事 用来做好事
use all that explosive potential of yours for good,

237
00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:00,240
说不定你的人生就能被改写
maybe we could rewrite your story, 

238
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,910
就像你为底城做的 你觉得呢
like you did with Zaun. What do you think?

239
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,200
好啊 蔚
Sure, Vi.

240
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,790
你永远都不会不管我的 对吗
You're never gonna give up on me, are you?

241
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
嘿
Hey!

242
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,040
好了 你不必再为我的事烦心了
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

243
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,540
也不必因为过得快乐而感到内疚
You don't need to feel guilty about being happy.

244
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,580
你应该和她一起
You deserve to be with her.

245
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,830
等一下
Wait.

246
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,870
我早就是无可救药了
There's no good version of me.

247
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,950
你想要干什么
What are you gonna do?

248
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,580
终结循环
Break the cycle.

249
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,250
金克丝
Jinx!

250
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,200
对不起
I'm sorry.

251
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,790
之前是我太蠢了
I've been an idiot.

252
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,500
太混蛋了
And an ass.

253
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,000
你也受伤了
You're hurting too.

254
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,580
自从我小时候记事起
For as long as I can recall,

255
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:21,370
我就一直努力成为 米达尔达家族的典范
I have chased the archetype of a Medarda.

256
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,660
我以为我的使命是让家族发扬光大
I believed it my calling to merit the blood in my veins.

257
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,040
而一切竟全是谎言
It was all a lie.

258
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,620
这血统对我而言是陌生的
This blood is alien to me.

259
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,660
然而它竟然能够主宰我的整个人生
Yet it has dictated the course of my entire life.

260
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:40,040
原来我只是一个过客
I'm no more than a passenger.

261
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,160
在自艾自怜中度日
A life I spent in self-pity.

262
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,330
现在都结束了 我再也回不去了
Now it's gone. I can never return to it.

263
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:53,120
我最近被很多事困惑
I've been confused about a lot lately.

264
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,370
但有一件事我深信不疑
But there's one thing I know in my bones.

265
00:23:55,910 --> 00:24:00,660
这世上没有什么力量能控制得了你
There is no force in this world that can control you.

266
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,830
你永远都不会只是个过客
You will never be a passenger.

267
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:39,790
肃静
Quiet.

268
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,750
恕我失礼 但留给我们的时间不多了
Forgive me. But we don't have much time.

269
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,200
暴风雨即将袭来
A storm is coming,

270
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,910
恐怕是一场皮尔特沃夫
the likes of which Piltover,

271
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:52,910
乃至整个符文之地都未曾经历过的
perhaps Runeterra itself, has never faced.

272
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,040
这个怪物
This creature 

273
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,120
潜入了各位现在所在的这个房间
infiltrated the very room you're standing in.

274
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
我们当时险些丧命
And we barely survived.

275
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:11,080
几百个这样的怪物正朝这儿来
Hundreds more are on the way.

276
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,910
在诺克萨斯将军的率领下
The Noxian general is leading them.

277
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,160
这场战争无关理想 也无关领土
This isn't a fight for ideals or territory.

278
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,830
而是关乎人性的存亡
It's a fight for humanity itself.

279
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,620
我请求 不 我恳求各位
I'm asking... No, begging you, every one of you, 

280
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:29,000
无论你是来自上城还是底城 请与我们并肩作战
Topside and bottom, to aid us in this coming war.

281
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,450
这场战争无法避免
And it will be a war.

282
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,910
这样的要求是有些强人所难 但这是我们唯一的希望
Now, this isn't a fair request, but it is our only hope.

283
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,120
敌人太过强大
The forces against us are too great.

284
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,330
我们必须团结一切可以团结的力量
We need every hand we can get.

285
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,660
把它推倒
Bring them down!

286
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,790
我们不得不放弃城郊 将布防集中到海克斯飞门
We're abandoning the city's outskirts to stage our defense at the Hexgates.

287
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,330
这是能拯救我们的最后堡垒
The final bastion of our salvation.

288
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,620
如果你选择逃难 那就别停下脚步
If you choose to flee, don't stop running.

289
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,200
但我选择战斗
But I'm choosing to fight.

290
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,540
我希望你们能跟我一起
And I pray that you will join me.

291
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,040
赶紧的 跟上 快去
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

292
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,870
就觉得你可能会在这儿
Had a feeling I might find you here.

293
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,000
我真的以为她肯帮忙的
I really believed she'd help.

294
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,870
说吧 说你早就提醒过我
Say it. You told me so.

295
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:41,160
我就是一个蠢货 居然还会再次相信她
I was an idiot to trust her. I went behind your back.

296
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,870
我背着你放走了她 每次我都选错
I choose wrong every time.

297
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:45,830
我的一错再错
And because of it, 

298
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,410
让所有人都离我而去
I've lost everyone.

299
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,040
你真以为我非得把守卫 都调去海克斯飞门不可吗
You really think I needed all the guards at the Hexgates?

300
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,040
不好意思 我看穿了你的小心思
Sorry to say, you've grown a bit predictable.

301
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,740
听我说
Uh, listen, 

302
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:28,660
你不在的时候 我和别人...
while you were gone, I saw someone...

303
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,660
凯特琳
Cait.

304
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:32,200
我他妈不在乎
I don't fucking care.

305
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,410
你还活着
You're alive.

306
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,080
我知道黒色玫瑰的事了
I know about the Black Rose.

307
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,830
你看到的只是表面 他们不过是虚假的谎言
You know a facade. They are nothing but lies.

308
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,790
你说过最高明的谎言 都披着真相的外衣
You taught me the best lies come wrapped in truth.

309
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,620
基诺到底出了什么事
What really happened to Kino?

310
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:53,080
你哥哥是被好奇心害死的
Your brother was struck with curiosity.

311
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,740
他掉进了他们布下的网
He got caught in their web

312
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,370
越是挣扎 就会越难挣脱
and, with every action, grew more deeply entangled.

313
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,160
你就由着他死了
So you let him die?

314
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,830
我怀胎十月生下他
I carried him in my belly,

315
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:04,870
一口一口奶水养大
nursed him from my bosom.

316
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,700
他是我心中最柔软的部分
He was all the sweetness in my heart.

317
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,700
所以他们才把他夺走
For that, they took him,

318
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,910
给我留下一道永远都无法愈合的伤口
carved into me a wound that will never close.

319
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:19,240
我真的希望你永远不用受这样的苦
I pray you never suffer the agony

320
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,790
为救一个孩子而不得不舍弃另一个
of being forced to forsake one child to save another.

321
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,410
你应该早点告诉我的
You should have come to me.

322
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:29,410
已经无可挽回 说了只会让你也难受
You'd have made the impossible intolerable.

323
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:31,700
我做了你做不到的事
I did what you could not.

324
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,040
为了你 为了家族
For you. For the family.

325
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,450
皮尔特沃尔和你的仇怨毫不相干
Piltover has nothing to do with your feud.

326
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:40,740
立刻上船 立刻启程离开这儿
Board your boats, leave our shores.

327
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:45,120
我和你一起走 我们一起为基诺复仇
I will join you. We can avenge Kino together.

328
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,410
这并非简单的复仇 孩子
This is more than vengeance, child.

329
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,870
这些法师在我们头顶悬了一把剑
These mages dangle over our heads a sword 

330
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:55,620
只要飞得过高 就会被刺穿
that impales us should we rise too high.

331
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:00,080
他们的本性违反了 诺克萨斯核心的原则
Their very nature violates the most core of Noxian principles,

332
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,450
那就是在战场上人人平等
that every one of us is equal on the battlefield.

333
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:08,580
运用计谋 挥洒汗水 钢铁护身
That through cunning, sweat, and steel...

334
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,330
命运要由自己掌控
we shape our destinies.

335
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,120
你跑来为你朋友们的生死游说
The fact you've come to parley for your friends' lives prove

336
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,160
足以证明你还不具备
you still lack the wrath necessary

337
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,080
打败黑色玫瑰这种劲敌 所需要的雷霆手段
to defeat an enemy like the Rose.

338
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,290
而我找到了其他办法
I've found another way.

339
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,700
试想一下 孩子
Imagine, child,

340
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:38,120
一支不必再畏惧死亡的军队
an army that need never fear death.

341
00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:47,700
母亲 你做了什么
What have you done, Mother?

342
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,200
博士
Doctor.

343
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,910
你现在可以开始了
You may begin the process.

344
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,790
那好吧
Very well.

345
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:27,200
看来是时候要说再见了
I guess this is goodbye.

346
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,450
真的非常感谢你 陪伴我度过孤独 杨小姐
Thank you very much for your company in my solitude, Ms. Young.

347
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,160
我会怀念我们曾说过的话
I will miss our talks.

348
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:53,700
不
No.

349
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,580
你不会的
You won't.

350
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,120
