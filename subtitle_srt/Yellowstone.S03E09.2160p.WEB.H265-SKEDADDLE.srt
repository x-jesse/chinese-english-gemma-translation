Is it bad?

10
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,640
来
Come on.

11
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,940
我知道  我知道
I know, I know, I know.

12
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,780
等我们回去
When we get back,

13
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:12,910
医生会把你治好的
the doctor, he'll fix you up just right.

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,960
谢谢
Thank you.

15
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:25,920
不客气
You're welcome.

16
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,560
不是很惨吧
That wasn't so bad, was it?

17
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,680
一点也不惨
No. Not too bad at all.

18
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,480
你应该趁我没毁容的时候干我
You should've fucked me while I still had a face

19
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,650
但没关系  我们慢慢来
but that's all right, we'll work on yer timin'.

23
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,720
*你该走了*
*It's time for you to go*

24
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,790
拿杯水  谢谢
Can I get some water, please?

25
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,830
你刚才唱的那首歌
That song you just sang.

26
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,670
是关于什么的
What was it about?

27
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,380
关于死亡吧
Well... I reckon it's about death.

28
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,090
你了解死亡吗
You know death?

29
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,510
算是专家吧
Kind of a expert on it.

30
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,680
你看起来也像是专家啊
You look like you're kind of a expert on it too.

31
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,180
差不多吧
Pretty much.

32
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,600
既然这样  那首歌送给你
Well... then that last song was for you.

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,440
你要去哪里
Where you headed?

34
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,610
回家
Headin' home.

35
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,320
你家在哪
Where's that?

36
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,910
今晚的家我还没选好
Ain't picked tonight's home yet.

37
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,240
我能帮你选吗
Can I pick it for you?

38
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,250
那首歌就是我最后的倔强了
I think up on that stage is about as good as I get.

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,840
我没什么可以给你的了
I'm afraid I ain't got much left to give.

40
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,630
让我来吧
I'll do the giving.

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,260
如果我没这么穷困潦倒的话
If I weren't such miserable fucking company,

42
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,970
我肯定愿意当你的炮友
I'd damn sure take you up on that.

这才叫饼干嘛
That's how you make a fucking biscuit.

45
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,100
怎么了
What's wrong?

46
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,640
就是酸痛
Just sore.

47
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,600
每一块肌肉
Every muscle.

48
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,400
全身都疼
Every one of them.

49
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,900
我理解这种感觉
I know the feeling.

50
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,820
十年来  每次行动后我都有这种感觉
I felt like that after every op for ten years.

51
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,400
你没习惯吗
Didn't get used to it?

52
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,610
习惯了一点吧  但你不需要习惯
Little bit. But you don't need to get used to it

53
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,870
因为你再也不用做这种事了  对吧
'cause you're never gonna pull that shit ever again. Right?

54
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,740
嗯  没有下次了
No, I got that out of my system.

55
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,330
治疗酸痛的最好办法是睡觉
Well, the best cure for the soreness is sleep.

56
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,960
你继续睡觉吧  宝贝
So why don't you just go back to bed, baby?

57
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,550
我要带泰特去买学习用具
No, I gotta take Tate school shopping.

58
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,050
今晚要见老师
Tonight is a meet the teacher night,

59
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,840
你也要去
I want you to be there.

60
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,100
我在这个山谷里谁也不认识
I don't know anyone in this valley

61
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,430
我不想一个人去
and I don't want to be there by myself.

62
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,930
你就别去了
You shouldn't go at all.

63
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:17,230
我们让他在家上学吧
We should home school him.

64
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,360
他需要学的东西都在这里
Everything he needs to learn is right here.

65
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,110
全州最好的老师是他妈妈
And why do we send him to school

66
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,440
还送他上学干嘛
when the best teacher in the whole state is his mother?

67
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,900
因为他妈妈还有自己的课要教
Because his mother's got classes of her own.

68
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,320
我还没准备好放弃我的事业
I'm not ready to give up my career yet.

69
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,830
我没想让你放弃
I'm not asking you to.

70
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,290
但如果他的未来是管理这里的话
But if his future is running this place,

71
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,290
这就是他需要学习的全部
then this is all he needs to be studying.

72
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,210
谁来教他呢  你吗
And who's going to teach him that, you?

73
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,500
我爸
My dad.

74
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,090
他现在啥事都没有
Hell, he's got nothing else going on.

75
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,670
全靠我们运作
He's got us running everything.

76
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,130
祖父母不就是干这个的吗
That's what grandpas are for, right?

77
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,050
你父亲和我育儿价值观不同吧
Yeah, I don't think your father and I share the same parenting values.

78
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,970
他从没打过我屁股
He never spanked me once.

79
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,100
嗯  只是给你烙了个印
No. Just burned his brand into you.

80
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,060
他和当年不一样了
He was different then.

81
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,860
我也是
So was I.

82
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,700
我的看法不一样了
I see it different now.

83
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:09,910
我现在理解烙印了
I understand it.

84
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,700
反正我永远都不理解
Well, I'll never understand it.

85
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
你得答应我一件事  宝贝
And you gotta promise me something, baby.

86
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,000
答应我坚持最初的看法
Promise me you'll see that for what it was.

87
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,210
不要改变
Don't ever see it different.

88
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,830
答应我
Promise.

89
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,630
我答应你
I promise.

90
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:31,300
算了  我还是继续睡觉吧
Yeah, fuck it. I'm going back to bed.

91
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,100
什么时候开家长会
What time is this meet the parent deal?

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,650
没事
Doesn't matter.

93
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,980
我们不去了
'Cause we're not going.

94
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,860
他在农场学到的课程
The lessons he learns on this ranch,

95
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,150
其他学校都教不了
no school could ever teach.

96
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,580
我会和你父亲谈谈的
I'll talk to your father about it.

97
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,730
有空吗
Got a minute?

98
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,890
怎么了
For what?

99
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,610
里普有东西要给你看
Rip's got something he needs to show you.

100
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,480
很糟糕吗
Is it bad?

101
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,860
非常糟糕
Couldn't be much worse.

102
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,360
他在新谷仓
He's out at the New Barn.

103
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,530
上车吧  我送你过去
Jump in. I'll drive you down.

104
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,200
不  这是你和他之间的事
Nah, I think this is between you and him.

105
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,060
怎么了
What's going on?

106
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,350
我发现一个你忘记处理的东西
Found something that you forgot to get rid of.

107
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,690
什么东西
What's that?

108
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:12,990
他在哪里
Where was he?

109
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,570
在迪伦的酒吧唱歌
Singing in a fucking bar in Dillon.

110
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,410
我们得知道他跟什么人说了什么  凯斯
We need to know who he told and what, Kayce.

111
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:22,290
然后我来解决这个问题
And then I got to put that problem in the ground.

112
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,000
但是在此之前  你得告诉我
But before I do that, you're going to tell me

113
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,250
为什么这个问题还在呼吸
why the fuck that problem is still breathing.

114
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,050
在你见过的人里  属我杀人最多
You'll never meet a man who's killed more men than me.

115
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:32,420
但我从来没有杀过平民
But I ain't never murdered one.

116
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,220
我永远也不会
I never will.

117
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,470
把他带进谷仓吧
Just bring him into the barn.

118
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,270
走吧  出来
All right, let's go. Get out.

119
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,650
别走开
Stick around, Rip.

120
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,450
咱们就地解决
Let's just figure this all out right now.

121
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
又回到这里了  真他妈爽
Back at this fucking place. Go figure.

122
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:07,920
你答应了我
You gave me your word.

123
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,540
我没说出去
I kept it. I ain't said shit.

124
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,880
你说你要离开这个州
You said you were going to leave the state

125
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,960
再也不回来的
and never come back.

126
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,380
可你又回来了
Here you are.

127
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:16,050
我在假释中  凯斯
I'm on parole, Kayce.

128
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,050
每两周就要报到
I gotta check in every couple weeks

129
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,470
否则这辈子都得逃命了
or else I'm just running for the rest of my fucking life.

130
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,970
你下次在酒吧打架会怎么样  沃克
What happens when you get in your next bar fight, Walker?

131
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,680
警察把你按到墙上
The police got you up against the wall

132
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,600
你唯一可以用来交换自由的筹码
and the only thing that you can trade for

133
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,230
就是我们
your fucking freedom is us?

134
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,940
你想过吗  凯斯
Ever think about that, Kayce?

135
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,370
你想回来工作吗  沃克
Want your job back, Walker?

136
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,620
当然不想
Hell, no.

137
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,000
我每次转过身
This motherfucker trying to crack my skull

138
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,290
这家伙就想干爆我的头
every time I turn around?

139
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,210
我是在给你找个出路
I'm trying to find a way out for you.

140
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,210
你得帮我
You gotta help me, here.

141
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,550
你也一样
So do you.

142
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,090
凯斯  如果可以信守承诺  我肯定没意见
Kayce, I got no problem with a man that does what he's told.

143
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,050
但他做不到
But he won't.

144
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,850
不行  他必须得等价交换
Nah. He's gotta give us something as good as he knows.

145
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,980
你们想要我的把柄吗
You want something you can hold over my head?

146
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,150
你得证明自己  沃克
You're gonna have to prove yourself, Walker.

147
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,310
只要你能证明  你想走还是想留  都随你
Once you do, the choice to stay or leave is up to you.

148
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,280
总比死强吧
Beats dying.

149
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,450
在我看来  这是目前唯一的选择
As far as I see it, that's the only other option right now.

150
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,410
这个该死的地方
This fucking place.

151
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,920
就是块磁铁  把世界上所有的错误都吸引过来了
It's a magnet for everything wrong in this fucking world.

152
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,380
这不就把你吸回来了
Well, it drew you back.

153
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,040
你犯了什么错
What's wrong with you?

154
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,140
过了这村没这店了
I ain't gonna offer it again.

155
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:01,820
门开着  进来吧
Door's open. Come on in.

156
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,580
原谅我的穿着
Pardon the way I'm dressed.

157
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,170
我刚做完瑜伽
Just finished my yoga.

158
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,630
穿着长袍吗
In a robe?

159
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,250
我裸体做的
Do it naked.

160
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,300
衣服会限制身体的自然运动
Clothing restricts the body's natural movement.

161
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,550
如果我们按照上帝创造我们的方式生活
It'd be a better world if we went about our days

162
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,840
世界会变得更美好
just the way God made us.

163
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,760
请坐
Have a seat.

164
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,850
怎么样了
So how's it going?

165
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,770
我们把他们逼得很紧
We've been pushing them pretty hard.

166
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,560
很好  继续努力
Good. Keep pushing.

167
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,310
我不想回监狱
I ain't trying to go back to prison

168
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,820
也不想被杀
and I ain't trying to get killed.

169
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,280
你们所做的一切都是合理的
Everything you've done has been justified:

170
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,400
他们骚扰我们的牲畜  你们把他们赶走了
they harassed our livestock and you ran them off.

171
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,240
如果上了法庭  这就是宣判结果
That's the way this will play out in a court of law.

172
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,410
继续逼他  让他做出我们可以在法庭上利用的事
Now keep pushing until he does something else we can use in court.

173
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,160
我再找点人来
I'm going to bring some more men on.

174
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,620
我可不希望他找十几个牧人
I don't want a dozen of his wranglers

175
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,410
把我拖进灌木蒿丛
dragging me through the sagebrush.

176
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,540
随你啊
Bring on whoever you like,

177
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,340
最好有人能被拖进灌木蒿丛
but somebody had better get drug through the sagebrush.

178
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,800
如果没有任何损失  我们就不能起诉要求赔偿
We can't sue for damages if there aren't any damages.

179
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,180
你没我那么了解约翰·杜顿
You don't know John Dutton like I do.

180
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,350
所以我付你那么多钱嘛
That's why the job pays so well.

181
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,390
继续逼那个混蛋
So keep poking him till that son of a bitch

182
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,100
让他做一些无法挽回的事情
does something he can't take back.

183
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,020
走吧
Let's go.

184
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,210
怎么回事
What the fuck happened?

185
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,130
那些业余牛仔
Those dude-string cowboys.

186
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,090
她需要医生
She needs a doctor.

187
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,510
好吧  来  给我
Okay, come on. Give her to me.

188
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,680
他们骑着马  想把我们踩死
They ran us down on horses. Tried to trample us to death.

189
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,690
罗伊德  叫兽医
Lloyd, call the vet.

190
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,320
抱歉  先生  你不吃早餐吗
Sorry, sir. You're not eating breakfast?

191
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,910
嗯  我今天起晚了
No, I slept in today.

192
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,540
我最后再说一遍  我有一种预感
For the last time, I got a feeling.

193
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,920
可以来点巧克力黑猩猩麦片吗
Can I have some Choco Chimps?

194
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,750
好的
Yeah, sure.

195
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,300
听起来不错
That sounds pretty good.

196
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,550
来两份吧  盖特
How about two of those, Gator?

197
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,340
你不想吃美味的熏肉吗  或者我
You don't want some tasty bacon or I got--

198
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,850
不了  我今天就吃巧克力黑猩猩麦片
No, I think Choco Chimps this morning.

199
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,350
看来我不是唯一嗜睡的人啊
Seems I'm not the only one sleeping in these days.

200
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,100
我的闹钟没响
My alarm didn't go off.

201
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:48,360
你为什么要设闹钟
And why... why are you setting an alarm?

202
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,570
我妈妈就是我的闹钟
My mom's my alarm.

203
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,440
不管我喜不喜欢  她早上6点就响
She goes off at 6:00 A.M. whether I like it or not.

204
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,950
今天她没起来
Today, she slept in.

205
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,990
天啊  我爱夏天
God, I love summer.

206
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:56,990
我也是
I do, too.

207
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,870
可惜夏天会结束
I hate for it to end.

208
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,080
是啊
Yeah.

209
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,080
事先声明
This is, for the record--

210
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,540
没事的  盖特
It's going to be fine, Gator.

211
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,680
-牛奶  -一点点就好
- Milk? - Just a little.

212
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,270
能让我先吃完早饭吗
Can I finish my breakfast?

213
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,980
这很重要
It's important.

214
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,400
我以为你上班去了呢
I thought you were at work.

215
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,770
今天帮我个忙  伙计  待在屋里  好吗
Do me a favor, today, buddy, and stay inside, okay?

216
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,030
房子里吗
Inside the house?

217
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:35,950
是的  看个电影什么的
Yeah, just... Watch a movie or something.

218
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,490
我吃完早饭就过去
I'm going to finish my breakfast, then I'll be down.

219
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,000
在谷仓等我
Meet me at the barn.

220
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,210
有点不对劲
Something's wrong.

221
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,750
看起来是的
Looks that way.

222
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,590
麦片要软了
It's gonna get soggy.

223
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,770
这么糟糕啊
That bad, huh?

224
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:13,730
本来可以更糟  但也糟不到哪去
Could have been worse, but not much.

225
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:16,190
需要步枪才能搞定吗
And it takes rifles to fix?

226
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,240
可能吧
It might.

227
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,970
出去吧
Let's go outside.

228
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,700
那个流浪汉什么时候回来的
When did that drifter wander back?

229
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,700
今天早上
This morning.

230
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,280
和他有关吗
He involved in this?

231
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,160
这是两码事
It's two separate things.

232
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,000
他们怎么了
What happened to them?

233
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,790
是你朋友韦德·莫罗干的  先生
Your friend Wade Morrow's what happened to them, sir.

234
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:12,670
用马踩了他们
He ran them down.

235
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,170
在我们的地盘上
On our side of the fence.

236
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,710
牧人们很不爽  想去找他们算账
Boys are pretty hot. They want to go after them.

237
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,380
他来这儿就一直在找我们麻烦
He's been goading our ass ever since he got here.

238
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,090
我也觉得很烦
He's been goading me pretty good, too.

239
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,510
那家伙是个恶棍和懦夫
That piece of shit is a bully and a coward,

240
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:28,930
但他不傻
but he ain't stupid.

241
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,940
他的工作不是让游客骑野牛
His job ain't riding tourists by buffalo.

242
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,940
这就是他的工作
This is what he was hired to do.

243
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,910
先生  你想怎么办
Well, sir, what do you want to do?

244
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,160
不能打电话给治安官
Can't call the sheriff.

245
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,330
嗯  他们已经考虑到了
No, they've already thought about that

246
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:53,540
肯定有了理由  借口或不在场证明
and already have a reason or an excuse or an alibi.

247
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,760
我们得做点什么
We got to do something.

248
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,850
没有人比我更想找那混蛋算账
I have more reason than anyone to go after that piece of shit.

249
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,930
你不能让他们鲁莽行事
You don't send them off half-cocked.

250
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,020
你得聪明点
You be smart about this.

251
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,690
想出一个可行的计划
You figure out a plan that works,

252
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:20,530
把那个垃圾送去火车站
and you take that trash to the fucking train station.

253
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:21,780
遵命
Yes, sir.

254
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:25,660
里普
Rip.

255
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,580
那狗娘养的拿了我的东西
That son of a bitch has something that belongs to me

256
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,710
我想拿回来
and I want it back.

262
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,310
达顿小姐
Miss Dutton, there's, um...

263
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,450
那是我的桌子
That's my desk.

264
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,030
不  现在是我的桌子了

266
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,320
我的办公室
My office.

267
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,830
牛仔有句话怎么说的来着
What's that saying cowboys use,

268
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,700
"敢惹公牛  就是找怼"
"fuck with the bull and you get the horns."

269
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,450
谁让你惹公牛了呢
Well, you fucked with the bull.

270
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,790
你在镜子前肯定练过这句话吧
I bet you practiced saying that in front of the mirror.

271
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,810
练了一个小时  任何事我都会准备周全
For an hour. I prepare for everything.

272
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,600
预期所有可能的结果
I anticipate every possible outcome.

273
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,770
我对你也是抱有同样的期待
And I would have expected the same from you,

274
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,400
但如果你动动脑子
but if you had given this any thought,

275
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,360
就会知道所有可能的结果
you would have known every possible outcome

276
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,970
都是让我坐在这里
leads to me sitting right here.

277
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,680
当你发现自己站在要塞的墙上时  威拉
When you find yourself standing on the wall of the Alamo, Willa,

278
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,660
结果就已经决定了
the outcome has already been decided.

279
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,330
唯一要做的就是在他们杀了你之前
The only thing left to do is to kill as much as you can

280
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,750
尽可能多地杀戮
before they kill you.

281
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,270
有理
I respect that.

282
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,650
你也斩获颇丰啊
And you certainly got your kills.

283
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,240
你这个小婊子
You little bitch.

284
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,990
害我的股东损失了数十亿美元
Cost my shareholders billions.

285
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:48,160
但现在因为这件事
But now, as a result,

286
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,790
我的股东变成了舒瓦茨和梅耶的大股东
my shareholders are majority owners of Schwartz and Meyer.

287
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,540
而你  被解雇了
And you, you're fired.

288
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,940
谢谢你在你父亲农场周围买的土地
So thank you for all that land around your father's ranch.

289
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,210
我们对这个山谷有宏大的版图
We have big plans for this valley.

290
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,550
在这种刺痛感消退后  给我打个电话
And after the sting of this fades, you should give me a call.

291
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,220
有了你  我肯定如虎添翼
You could do very well working for me.

292
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,190
当这一切结束后
When all this is over...

293
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,700
我要把你的文凭挂在我招待所马桶的上方
I'm gonna hang your diploma above my toilet in my guest house.

294
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,460
我向你保证
You have my word.

295
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,130
我说了  你得先等刺痛感消退
Like I said, you gotta let the sting fade.

296
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,960
然后我们可以谈谈
Then we'll talk.

297
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,760
我的刺痛感永远不会消退
The sting never fades with me.

298
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,060
这是一个痛苦的教训
It is a painful lesson.

299
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,400
下次就轮到你了
And one you're about to learn.

300
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,690
我真的很喜欢她
I really like her.

301
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,710
不好意思
Excuse me.

302
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,830
不好意思
Excuse me.

303
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,420
你是加勒特·兰德尔吗
Are you Garrett Randall?

304
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,260
谁找我
Who wants to know?

305
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,340
蒙大拿州的检察长
The attorney general of Montana.

306
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,010
这是你的老板吗
That who you work for?

307
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,100
这是我本人
That's who I am.

308
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,810
你找我干嘛
What do you want with me?

309
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,030
我只是想看看你
I just want to look at you.

310
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,820
看看有没有我的影子
See if I recognize anything in myself.

311
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,500
迈克
Michael?

312
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,920
这不是我的名字了
That's not my name anymore.

313
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,400
虽然你不承认
Well, that might not be what you call yourself

314
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,260
但这就是你的名字
but that's your name.

315
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,270
让我看看你
Let me look at you.

316
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,100
你的眼睛像你母亲
You got your mother's eyes.

317
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,740
别跟我提你杀的那个女人
Don't you mention the woman you killed to me.

318
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,530
看来你都查清楚了
I see, you got it all figured out, huh? You...

319
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,530
你都知道了
you know the score.

320
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,250
我和你母亲当时毒瘾很大
Your mother and I were strung out on so much shit.

321
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,520
有时我躺着看着天花板
I'd lie there some times, I'd stare up at the ceiling

322
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,420
还以为天花板在我身上融化了呢
and think the son of a bitch was melting on top of me.

323
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:14,550
但我们曾经也怀揣过希望
But at one time, we had hope.

324
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,720
我们梦想着未来
We dreamed about a future.

325
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:22,560
该死的毒品夺走了我们的一切  所以
Those goddam drugs took it all away from us, so...

326
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,350
你为什么这么做
Why did you do it?

327
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,080
你不需要知道
You don't need to know that.

328
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,980
我需要
Yes, I do. I need it.

329
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,490
为了我的灵魂
For my soul.

330
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,750
我想知道我到底是谁
To understand who the hell I am!

331
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,260
你想知道你是谁
You wanna know who the hell you are?

332
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,840
你母亲为了毒品出卖了她的身体
Your mother sold her body for drugs

333
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,080
所以我杀了她
and I killed her for it.

334
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,620
这就是你
That's who you are.

335
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,420
这就是你的母亲
That's where you come from.

336
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:50,040
看看你都变成什么样了
Look what you've made of yourself.

337
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,940
你母亲曾经有过美好的一面
See, there was good in your mother at one time.

338
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,890
她有优点  我也有优点
Good. There's good in her, good in me, too.

339
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,560
谢天谢地  你继承了我们的优点
Thank God those are the parts of us that he gave to you.

340
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,450
我可以说对不起  但如果没发生这些事
I'd say I'm sorry, but if things hadn't happened

341
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:13,230
你要么已经死了
the way they did, you'd be dead,

342
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:18,280
要么进监狱  要么和我一起焊接管围栏
you'd be in prison or you'd be welding pipe fence with me.

343
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,670
你走上了属于你的道路
You got put on the road you belong on.

344
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,160
继续前行吧  儿子
You stay on it, son.

345
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,950
约翰·达顿不该告诉你的
John Dutton never should have told you.

346
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,620
他没有
He didn't.

347
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,250
是我自己发现的
I found out myself.

348
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,560
好吧  真可惜
Oh, well, that's a shame.

349
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,630
现在你想了解我了
Now you're gonna want to know me.

350
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,780
我杀死了我所爱的一切
I've killed everything I ever loved

351
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,910
以及爱我的一切
and everything that ever loved me.

352
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,180
你不会想了解我的  儿子
You don't want to know me... son.

353
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,290
我必须了解你
I need to.

354
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,040
我从来不知道我是谁
I've never known who I was.

355
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,630
我一直觉得自己不完整
I've never felt like I was whole.

356
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,800
我必须了解你
I need to know you.

357
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,350
否则我将永远不了解自己
Or I will never know myself.

358
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,000
喝咖啡吗
You want some coffee?

359
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:37,750
好的
Sure.

360
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,180
来
Come on.

361
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,040
你得走了
You need to go.

362
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,600
吉米  怎么了
Jimmy, what happened?

363
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
我不能说
Can't really talk about it.

364
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:18,770
好吧
Okay,

365
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,550
我们先去波卡特洛的牛仔竞技赛  然后去奥格登
we're headed to the rodeo in Pocatello, then Ogden.

366
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,050
我们要是过来的话  就给你打电话
I'll just call you when we swing by this way.

367
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,020
你是哪里人
Where'd you come from?

368
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,020
无名之地
Nowhere.

369
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:41,030
生活就是喜欢找麻烦
Life just likes to hunt up fucking trouble.

370
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,110
一直找上我的门
Throw it at me.

371
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,360
诗人啊
A poet.

372
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:49,530
走吧
All right, let's go.

373
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,580
好了  起来  我们走
All right, get up, let's go.

374
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,580
别做傻事
Don't do anything stupid.

375
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,770
你们得离开这里一会儿
Y'all need to stay clear of here for a little while.

376
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,640
-明白吗  -嗯  吉米说过了
- You understand that? - Yeah, I got the memo.

377
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,210
吉米  我们走
All right, Jimmy, let's go.

378
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,920
你  我们走
You, okay, let's go.

379
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,520
你不用过来
You don't have to come.

380
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,360
不  我绝对不能错过
Oh, no. I wouldn't miss this for the fucking world.

381
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,730
是吗
Yeah?

382
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,330
我感觉这里正在失去光彩
This place is losing its luster to me.

383
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,210
我觉得可能还有点光彩
I don't know, I think there might be a little luster left.

384
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,280
他们还不明白我们的意图
They're sure slow to get the message.

385
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,090
我们把人都叫上来
Yeah. Maybe we ought to get the boys up here

386
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:10,660
再去招惹这群混蛋吧
before we mess with these assholes any more.

387
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,870
这他妈就一个人
It's one fucking guy.

388
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:19,460
我们的工作就是找麻烦  我们找点麻烦吧
You know, we're getting paid to stir trouble, let's stir some.

389
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,210
操  克林特  掉头
Shit! Clint, turn back!

390
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,520
杀了你们这群狗娘养的
I'll shoot every one of you sons of bitches!

391
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,390
死得这么痛快  便宜你了  混蛋
You got off easy, you piece of shit.

392
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,870
坐在这里吃晚饭感觉挺别扭的
Feels wrong, sitting here eating dinner

393
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:05,940
-我们应该去处理  -凯斯
- when we should be down there dealing with-- - Kayce.

394
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,020
处理什么
Dealing with what?

395
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,570
你今天过得怎么样  亲爱的
How was your day, honey?

396
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,410
我被炒了
I got fired.

397
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,710
这件事也不用详谈了吧
I guess we won't talk about that either.

398
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:27,680
让我们继续幻想
Let's just continue with the illusion

399
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,800
我们是一个幸福的大家庭
that we're one big, happy family.

400
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,480
这个家庭就是一个幸福的大家庭
That's exactly what this family is.

401
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,510
原来的确是
Well, that's exactly what it was.

402
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,430
现在嘛  我都不知道该用什么词形容了
I don't know what the fuck to call it anymore.

403
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,640
-够了  我受够了  -不  拜托
- That's it. That's fucking it. - No, please.

404
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,520
还是我走吧
Allow me.

405
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,530
泰特  走吧
Come on, Tate. Let's go.

406
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:09,750
这就是我们不在晚饭时谈论公事的原因
And that's why we don't talk about business at the dinner table.

407
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:11,090
以后不会了
Won't do it again.

408
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,180
我去看看泰特
I'll go check on Tate.

409
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,760
去吧
You do that.

410
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,230
走  杰伊  让他快点
Let's go, Jay, keep his ass moving.

411
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:37,570
快点  快点
Come on. Come on.

412
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,870
快点
Come on.

413
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,710
给我一个名字
I need a name.

414
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,040
什么名字
What name?

415
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,340
雇佣你的混蛋
The motherfuckers that hired you.

416
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,520
我不会再问第二遍
I'm not gonna ask you again.

417
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,260
直接开始凌迟
I'm just gonna start cutting shit off of you.

418
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,430
罗尔克
Named Roarke.

419
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:08,310
市场股票的混蛋
Market Equity son of a bitch.

420
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,290
放我下来
Let me down.

421
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,480
为什么
Why would I do that?

422
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,740
我要杀了你  你这个狗娘养的
I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch.

423
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,240
但是在此之前  我要拿回一个东西
But before I do, I'm gonna take something back.

424
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,780
你不配拥有这个烙印
You don't deserve to wear this fucking brand.

425
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,540
沃克  来
Walker, over here.

426
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,040
这是你最后的机会
This is your last chance.

427
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,050
证明自己  得到我们的信任
You prove yourself and you have our trust.

428
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,630
如果你不愿意
You turn your back on me now

429
00:36:40,610 --> 00:36:42,300
我就从你身上也拿点东西
and I'm gonna take something from you, too.

430
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,110
先生  我不认识你
Mister, I don't know you.

431
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,610
但如果你有这个烙印  肯定是个坏人
But if you're wearing that brand, you must be a bad man.

432
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,990
既然这群狗娘养的想要回去  那你肯定坏透了
And if these motherfuckers want it back, you must be even worse.

433
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,080
因果报应以各种形式和大小出现
Karma comes in all shapes and sizes.

434
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,290
看来今天就是我了
Looks like it's me today.

435
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,340
你们按住了
Y'all best hold him.

436
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:36,440
好
All right.

437
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,870
你们想报仇  现在报了
You all wanted revenge. Well, now you got it.

438
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,500
但报仇是要付出代价的
But there's a price to pay for revenge.

439
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,010
你们得付出代价
Now you gotta pay it.

440
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,690
他们没事
They're all fine.

441
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,940
对不起
Sorry... to, uh...

442
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,280
我在餐桌上提起这件事
to bring that up at the dinner table.

443
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,800
这种事本来就不应该出现
Well, there shouldn't be things like that

444
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,660
当然也就不用提起了
to discuss in the first place,

445
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,870
但这就是生活
but that's life.

446
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:02,790
如果你没有注意到  生活就是残酷和漠然的
In case you haven't noticed, it is cruel and uncaring.

447
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,760
你无法跟邪恶讲理  儿子
You can't reason with evil, son.

448
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,280
邪恶想要什么就会索取  而且不会停止
Evil wants what it wants and won't stop

449
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,640
直到胜利或者被消灭
until it's won or you kill it.

450
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:22,980
消灭邪恶的唯一方法就是比它更卑鄙
The only way to kill it is to be meaner than evil.

451
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,790
这是你的最后一课  儿子
That's going to be your last lesson, son:

452
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,990
如何比邪恶更卑鄙
how to be meaner than evil

453
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,490
但仍然爱着你的家人
and still love your family.

454
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,410
还可以享受日出
And still enjoy a sunrise.

455
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,680
{\an8}怀俄明州
永远的西部

456
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,800
为什么你们都把尸体扔在这里
Why y'all dump them here?

457
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,550
因为这里一百英里之内没有人住
'Cause no one lives within a hundred miles.

458
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,590
这个县没有人  没有治安官
It's a county with no people, no sheriff,
