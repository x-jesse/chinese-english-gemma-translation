1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,870
梅尔
Mel.

2
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,500
梅尔 没事吧
Mel, are you okay?

3
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,830
没事
It's okay.

4
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:36,620
不
No.

5
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,870
- 梅尔 受伤了没有  - 我没事
- Are you hurt? - I'm fine.

6
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,410
你别动 我来处理

7
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,830
那边 快 快去
Go, go.

8
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,370
{\an8}《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第一集

9
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,370
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

10
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,540
她是个了不起的人
She was a great woman.

11
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,580
是一位挚友
A good friend.

12
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,500
没了她 我不知该如何应对这次危机
I don't know how we'll face this crisis without her.

13
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,080
我们竟然差点把自治权交给了
To think we nearly extended sovereignty

14
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,580
犯下这等罪行的禽兽
to the creatures who did this.

15
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,750
肩负着维护秩序的重任
We're charged with imposing order.

16
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,160
可我们却如此的懈怠
And we've been asleep at our posts.

17
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,950
现在我算看清了
Well, my eyes are open.

18
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,200
一天不将底城这帮残党余孽彻底铲除
There will be no more fairy tales of peace 

19
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,080
和平就只能化为梦幻泡影
until we scour our basement of its demons.

20
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,450
感谢你对萨罗议员的帮助 母亲
So kind of you to assist Councilor Salo, Mother.

21
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,160
既然我们身陷战争
As we are at war,

22
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,330
我认为请这位久经沙场的老将
I thought it prudent to solicit the advice 

23
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,250
指点一二再好不过了
of such an experienced veteran.

24
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,790
还是先解决眼下的问题吧
Let us address the matter at hand.

25
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,410
现在到处人心惶惶 生灵涂炭
Our people are scared, suffering.

26
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,120
得让所有人知道我们能够控制住局面
They need to know their leaders have the situation under control.

27
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,080
直接给他们点颜色瞧瞧
An unprecedented show of force.

28
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,120
派我们的执法官荡平底城
We flood the undercity with Enforcers, 

29
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,120
带上海克斯武器
armed with Hextech.

30
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,910
这么做会伤及无辜的平民
Innocents will be caught in the cross fire.

31
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,700
到底要看到多少个 议员被炸得粉身碎骨
How many more councilors have to be blown to pieces 

32
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,080
你才肯醒悟啊
before you wake up?

33
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,330
我们现在腹背受敌
We are under siege.

34
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,250
她为什么会在这儿
What is she doing here?

35
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,500
吉拉曼恩执法官亲眼目睹了袭击
Officer Kiramman witnessed the attack firsthand.

36
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,700
她能够证实这是一个 精神错乱者的个人行为
She confirmed this was the act of a single deranged individual.

37
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,370
金克丝
Jinx.

38
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,370
希尔科死了
Silco is dead.

39
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:20,450
底城现在群龙无首
The underground, leaderless.

40
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,700
如果按照你们的想法办
If we follow your plan, 

41
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:23,580
反而可能令他们团结起来
we risk unifying them against us.

42
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,700
那你的高见是什么
So, what is your solution? 

43
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:28,040
是公开声讨 还是严厉斥责
Chastisement? A firm reprimand?

44
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,000
把罪责都推到金克丝身上
We use their division against them.

45
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,660
让他们产生分歧
Pin the attack on Jinx,

46
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,410
重金悬赏 开出他们无法拒绝的价码
post a reward too substantial to ignore.

47
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,660
很抱歉 梅尔
I'm sorry, Mel. 

48
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,450
拿我们的命运去做赌注 我觉得不妥
I'm not comfortable trusting our fates to chance.

49
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,330
金克丝从来就不可控
Jinx has proven elusive.

50
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:41,700
只有将她绳之以法
Our healing can only begin 

51
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:43,700
我们的伤痛才能被彻底终结
once she's been brought to justice.

52
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,540
结论很明显了
Then it's settled, 

53
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,750
二比一
2 to 1.

54
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,330
主动出击
We invade.

55
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,950
请听我说一句
If I may? 

56
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,870
面对这样的局面
In crises such as these,

57
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,540
当务之急是统一意见 给民众一个交代
it's imperative you present a unified front to the public,

58
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,540
个人感受先放一边
whatever your personal feelings.

59
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,410
真知灼见啊
How wise.

60
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,250
我赞成下令主动出击
I'll agree to endorse the invasion.

61
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,830
但我反对利用海克斯科技
But I draw the line at Hextech.

62
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,870
这点上早有共识
We have an ethos.

63
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,040
不到万不得已 不能动用这种武力
Such force must be a final resort.

64
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,870
完全同意
Agreed.

65
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,660
结论很明显了
Then it's settled, 

66
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,830
二比一
2 to 1.

67
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,910
我本来有机会的
I had the shot.

68
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,700
这是你母亲留给你的
Your mother left this to you.

69
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,080
吉拉曼恩家族钥匙
The Kiramman Key?

70
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,160
不 我还没…
No, I'm not…

71
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,290
我根本不配
I don't deserve it.

72
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,080
以后就交给你了 凯特琳
It's your legacy now, Caitlyn.

73
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,040
她为什么还在这儿
What is she still doing here?

74
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,950
嘿
Hey.

75
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,410
你说得对 凯特琳
You were right, Cait.

76
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,910
她不是爆爆了
Powder's gone.

77
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,000
我有办法补救
I can make this right.

78
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,200
如果你能说服杰斯修好拳套
If you get Jayce to fix the gauntlets, 

79
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,500
我自己一个人去 就不会再害得别人受伤了
I can do this myself. No one else needs to get hurt.

80
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,200
不
No.

81
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,700
不要再轻举妄动
No more rogue mission.

82
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,580
也不要再意气用事
No more reckless plans.

83
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,330
我妈妈说得对
My mother was right.

84
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,500
我总是自以为是 爱逞强
My arrogance led me to take on more than I could handle,

85
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,410
结果…
and 

86
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,080
让她赔上了性命
she paid the price.

87
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,250
他们要派执法官追捕金克丝
They're sending all the Enforcers after Jinx.

88
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,950
我会一起去
I'm going with them.

89
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,910
让我去 让我做点什么
Please, I have to help.

90
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,790
可以啊
You can.

91
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,000
来加入我们
As one of us.

92
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,910
凯特琳 这东西我没法戴
Cait, I can't wear this.

93
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,410
民众要求血债血偿
People are calling for blood.

94
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,910
议会不会阻拦
The Council won't stop them.

95
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,830
并非每个底城人都支持金克丝
You can show that not all of Zaun supports Jinx.

96
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,120
我们一起
We can show them.

97
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,950
证明这点
Together.

98
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,000
他们在我的面前杀死了我的父母
I watched them kill my parents.

99
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,660
你懂那是种什么感觉吗
Do you have any idea how that feels?

100
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,500
我懂 我都懂
Yes. I do.

101
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,290
我本以为我们是一边的
I thought you were on our side.

102
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,790
你根本就没有考虑过我
You didn't think at all.

103
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,580
怎么回事儿
Hey, watch it.

104
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,830
抱歉
Sorry.

105
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,870
也不是头一回了
Not my first.

106
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,200
你没事吧
You all right?

107
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,660
那场袭击 你也有亲人遇难了
You, uh… lose someone in the attack?

108
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,370
他怎么样了
How is he?

109
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,910
跟之前一样 有呼吸
Same as before. Breathing.

110
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,330
脉搏稳定
Pulse is consistent.

111
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,540
除此之外
Beyond that,

112
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,160
我知道的也不比你多
your guess is good as mine.

113
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,700
这东西把他怎么了
What's it doing to him?

114
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:46,910
海克斯核心在不断进化
The Hexcore has been evolving.

115
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,120
符文样式瞬息万变 我都跟不上了
Shifting through runic patterns faster than I can keep up.

116
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,620
我只能确定它维持着他的生命
All I know for certain is that it's keeping him alive.

117
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,250
这种谜题他最感兴趣 只可惜…
It's the sort of puzzle Viktor would love if he wasn't…

118
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,580
受伤的人应该是我才对
It should be me up there instead of him.

119
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,160
别这么说
Don't say that.

120
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,830
他会好起来的
He'll come back to us.

121
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:11,540
我怎么都想不通
I still don't understand.

122
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,330
他当时就在我旁边
He was right next to me.

123
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:16,790
为什么爆炸把他炸成这样 而我却…
How does the explosion do that to him, and I just…?

124
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,700
而我却毫发无伤 安然无恙
I just walk out without a scratch?

125
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,040
有些事是没有道理的 杰斯
There's no sense to these things, Jayce.

126
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,660
议会那边怎么样了
How'd it go with the Council?

127
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,450
我母亲也参与进来了
My mother's entered the game.

128
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,910
她成功取得了萨罗的信任
She's already gotten her hooks into Salo.

129
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,200
表面上像是帮他
Using his grief to make a play 

130
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,790
但心里只有海克斯科技
for Hextech.

131
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,500
梅尔 我答应过维克托
Mel, I promised Viktor,

132
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,790
再也不会…
never again.

133
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,410
别担心 我已经解决了
It's all right. I handled it.

134
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,910
我不会让他们毁掉你的梦想
I won't let them corrupt your dream.

135
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,330
凯特琳当时也在
Caitlyn was there.

136
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,950
你是不是该去看看她
You might pay her a visit.

137
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,000
这姑娘虽然极力掩饰
She hides it admirably, 

138
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,830
但心里一定很难受
but the poor girl's in so much pain.

139
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,040
嘿 小豆芽
Hey, Sprout.

140
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,910
你怎么找来的
How'd you find me?

141
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,120
你爸说的
Your dad.

142
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,660
妈妈和我想清净的时候常来这儿
Mother and I used to come here when we needed an escape.

143
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,620
也是我们难得不吵架的地方
One of the few places we never argued.

144
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:13,200
真对不起 我现在才来
I'm sorry I haven't been around.

145
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,410
维克托怎么样了
How's Viktor?

146
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,910
我都不确定他是不是活着
I can't even tell if he's still in there.

147
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,870
那次袭击后
Ever since it happened…

148
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,700
有三张面孔不停地在我脑子里打转
three faces keep spinning through my mind.

149
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,700
我看见我妈妈她死时的样子
I see Mother. When they found her.

150
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,950
我整个人就开始往下沉
And every fiber of me just sinks,

151
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
像一块石头被黑水吞没
like a stone swallowed in dark water.

152
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,700
然后我看到了金克丝 她在笑
But then there's Jinx. Laughing.

153
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,580
我想掐住她的喉咙
I want to tear that laugh 

154
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,700
让她再也笑不出来
from her throat forever.

155
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,620
凯特琳
Cait.

156
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,290
我知道
I know.

157
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:55,580
我现在才明白要恨一个人有多容易
I just understand now how easy it is to hate them.

158
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,790
一次恶行就够了
One vicious act.

159
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,200
我还看见了蔚
Then I see Vi.

160
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,950
我想要拉她当执法官
I asked her to put on the uniform.

161
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,790
不说也知道 她没有答应
Suffice to say, she declined.

162
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,370
蔚 当执法官
Vi? Wear a badge?

163
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,700
她以为只要有你那副拳套
She thinks those gauntlets of yours will solve 

164
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,370
就能解决一切问题
all her problems.

165
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,410
如果她是对的呢
What if she's right?

166
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,750
海克斯科技或许可以保命
Hextech may keep us alive, Jayce,

167
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,000
但问题仍然无法根除
but it's not what will save us.

168
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,750
我
Me.

169
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,330
加入那群虾兵蟹将
Join the peanut patrol. Ha.

170
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,120
我还以为她没什么幽默感呢
And I thought she had no sense of humor.

171
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,540
虾酱 好吃
I like peanuts.

172
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,830
她爸说得对
Her dad's right.

173
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:46,580
确实没有必要再待在这儿了
There's no point in sticking around up here.

174
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,450
只是 是我制造出了那个怪物
Except… I'm the one who created the monster.

175
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,330
蔚
Vi?

176
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,160
你谁啊
Who are you? 

177
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,870
你怎么知道我叫蔚啊
And how do you know my name?

178
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,450
我是初级执法官诺伦…
Junior Officer Nolen.

179
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,250
麦迪
Maddie.

180
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:17,580
那个…
And, uh…

181
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,410
你脸上不是写着嘛
it's written on your face.

182
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,620
有什么事儿吗
So, what is it?

183
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,500
随机抽查 还是要强制驱逐
Random search? Escort off the property?

184
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,870
不会只是想要浪费我的时间吧
Or you just here to waste my time?

185
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,290
抽查 不是
Search? No.

186
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,330
不 你在…
No, no. Heh.

187
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:38,370
在执法官之间可是个传奇人物
Uh, you're something of a legend amongst the Enforcers.

188
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,120
有人反对你的加入
Caitlyn made quite a scene at the station 

189
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,700
凯特琳为此大闹了一场
when they tried to deny your enlistment.

190
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,540
我必须得问问
Now I have to ask,

191
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,700
是真的吗
is it all true?

192
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,830
不靠议会 你单枪匹马就去追希尔科去了
You went after Silco alone when the Council wouldn't back you?

193
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,290
挑他们一群人
Took on his whole gang?

194
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,870
这是她说的
Cait said all that?

195
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:57,080
她还说要是执法官都有你这种胆量
She said if every Enforcer had a heart like yours,

196
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,080
我们就能对付诺克萨斯了
we could take on Noxus itself.

197
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:02,500
她还拿她们家撤资当要挟
Then she threatened to withdraw her family's funding.

198
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,910
总之欢迎你加入
Anyhow, I'm glad you're joining up.

199
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,700
自打长官变节后
After the sheriff betrayed 

200
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,120
我…
us…

201
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,370
这么说吧
Well, let's just say…

202
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,000
知道这儿还有好人
it's nice to know there 

203
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,330
多少能得到些安慰
are still good ones left.

204
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,000
我要去巡逻了
Duty calls.

205
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,040
很高兴认识你
A real honor, Vi.

206
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:55,040
成为议员的众多特权之一就是
One of the many privileges of serving as your councilor

207
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,910
可以时不时地 站上这个讲台 为民众发声
is having the occasion now and again to stand behind this podium

208
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,500
今天我们相聚一堂
to behold so many

209
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,700
不是因为出身或义务在身
joined together not by birth 

210
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,200
而是因为我们有共同点
or dictum but by all that we share.

211
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:09,580
我们的希望
Our hope.

212
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,870
我们的好奇心
Our curiosity.

213
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,580
以及我们身上背负的
Our compulsion to leave behind us 

214
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,080
想留下一个更好世界的使命
a world better than that before.

215
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,950
正是这些共同点
These things we share are 

216
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,660
才让我们能够团结一心
what make us one people.

217
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,250
今天
Today 

218
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,870
我们在这里
we share an 

219
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,040
一起沉痛悼念
unthinkable loss.

220
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:46,200
伊利乌斯波尔波克议员
Councilor Irius Bolbok,

221
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,370
托曼霍斯卡尔议员
Councilor Torman Hoskel,

222
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,500
以及卡桑德拉吉拉曼恩议员
and Councilor Cassandra Kiramman 

223
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,750
离开了我们
were taken from us.

224
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,250
他们会被永远铭记
But they shall not be forgotten.

225
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,500
我们建造雕像的初衷
We commissioned this statue

226
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,450
是为了铭记他们的丰功伟绩
so we may remember them for their countless contributions…

227
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,660
纪念他们毕生的付出
their lifetimes of service.

228
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,950
而不是记录夺取他们生命的卑劣行为
Not for the craven act that stole them away.

229
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,870
喂 干什么
Ma'am, you can't go in…

230
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,750
我们遭到了沉重的打击
Though we've suffered a terrible blow,

231
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,120
但我向你们保证
I assure you, 

232
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,950
在皮尔特沃夫 我们执法必严
the rule of law prevails in Piltover.

233
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,500
- 不… - 我们必将缉拿施暴者
- No. - We will find those responsible.

234
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:32,790
并让他们付出应有的代价
And they will account for their crimes.

235
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,950
滋味不好受吧
Awful, isn't it?

236
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,410
失去所爱之人
Losing a loved one.

237
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,950
别以为住在上城就安全了
You aren't safe up here, toppers.

238
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,410
谁都跑不了
None of you are safe.

239
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,750
走啊
Go.

240
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:57,540
你快带议员离开 我有个主意
Get the counselors out of here. I have an idea.

241
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,580
你要干什么去
What are you doing?

242
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,870
替我儿子偿命
For my son.

243
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:08,500
来吧
Come on.

244
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,290
该死
Shit.

245
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,330
都解决了
Perimeter secured.

246
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,250
看吧
We'll see.

247
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,870
我还以为你这次死定了呢
Thought you were gonna get yourself killed.

248
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,410
这是追思会
A memorial.

249
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,370
没事了
I got you.

250
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,370
他们简直不是人
What kind of animals?

251
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,950
他们就想把事情闹大
They wanted the spectacle.

252
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,410
就想让你们害怕
They're trying to scare you.

253
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,040
我只觉得怒不可遏
All they did is piss me off.

254
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,450
你…
You…

255
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:30,080
你得想个办法让他们取消这次行动
You need to find a way to call off the invasion.

256
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,080
什么
What?

257
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,330
今天这一仗都已经这么惨了
This battle was on your soil.

258
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,540
到了那边可就是他们说了算了
Down there, you'll be on their terms.

259
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,750
都到这份上了

260
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,330
没什么是我们能说了算的
None of this is on our terms.

261
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,830
也许你该想想办法
Maybe you should change that. 

262
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,750
那你说有什么办法 你说
I don't know how, okay?

263
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:45,660
她死了 留下一个这么大的窟窿
She dies and leaves this giant hole,

264
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,910
就好像该我来补
and I'm just supposed to fill it.

265
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,660
仿佛她的努力都毫无意义
Like she was never there to begin with.

266
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:53,540
补不上的
Hey. You won't.

267
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,700
窟窿会变小 但是…
The hole gets smaller, but…

268
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,750
永远补不好
you never fill it.

269
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,660
我不该把徽章塞给你的
I was wrong to spring the badge on you.

270
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,040
只是…
It's just…

271
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,790
不管我怎么做
every way I slice it,

272
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,370
如果我跟你妹妹碰上
if I go after your sister alone,

273
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,660
不是她死 就是我亡
one of us comes back in a box.

274
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,080
无可挽回了
It's all coming apart.

275
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,160
可以挽回的
No, it isn't.

276
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,910
只要我们一起
We won't let it.

277
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:41,620
我知道你对自己 与生俱来的权力很介怀
I know you doubt the merit of your birthright, Caitlyn.

278
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,910
你也有你的道理
There's wisdom in that.

279
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,660
可是要记住
But remember:

280
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,950
你姓吉拉曼恩
You're a Kiramman.

281
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,950
皮尔特沃夫的历史上
Never in our lifetimes has Piltover's 

282
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,950
还从来没有出现过议员 被迫躲进地牢开议会这种事
leadership been forced into the dungeons of our capitol.

283
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,290
看看我们现在
But here we are.

284
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,000
现在还有人觉得
Does anyone still doubt 

285
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,080
我们的敌人只是一个 精神错乱的疯子吗
that our enemy is greater than one deranged individual?

286
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,540
他们是怎么让那些怪物潜入会场的
How did they sneak so many of these things into the ceremony?

287
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,040
我还以为我们的安保措施万无一失
I thought we took every measure to secure it.

288
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,040
他们一定有内应
They must have had help.

289
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,500
大概率是上城的人
From someone up here.

290
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,120
我们不能再坐以待毙了
We can't afford any more handwringing.

291
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,580
再不启用海克斯科技来保命
If we do not defend ourselves with Hextech,

292
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,290
所有的原则都将毫无意义
our principles will mean nothing.

293
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:57,750
我…
I…

294
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,700
我们还没有做好全面出击的准备
We aren't prepared for a full-scale invasion.

295
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,950
这次袭击就是证明
The undercity's attack proved that.

296
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,250
这是议员的内部会议
This is a closed Council meeting. 

297
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,540
谁让你进来的
Who let you in here?

298
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,200
我既是有功勋的执法官
I am a decorated officer.

299
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,080
也是吉拉曼恩家的当家人
Leader of House Kiramman.

300
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,660
要么对我尊重点 要么就把嘴给我闭上
Address me with respect, or keep your mouth shut.

301
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:19,830
我会带突击队去底城完成三项任务
I will lead a strike team into Zaun with three objectives:

302
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,540
找到金克丝
locate Jinx,

303
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,500
摧毁微光
dismantle Shimmer,

304
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,370
铲除所有效忠于希尔科的残党余孽
and neutralize any agents still loyal to Silco.

305
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,540
你凭什么觉得自己 比其他的战士们出色呢
What makes you think you'll fare better than our forces today?

306
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,450
我们自有办法出奇制胜
We've got a few surprises of our own.

307
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,700
（进化人物）

308
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,410
