你去是上班
Should you go to work...

14
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,760
还是躺在我身上
Or should you lie on top of me?

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,140
我没那么有福气  早上和你做爱
God don't like me enough to give me you in the morning

16
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,640
还能过一个宁静的下午

17
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,110
你想早上和我做爱
Me in the morning...

这是个艰难的选择
That's a tough choice.

00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,360
靠  我也想骑烈马把后背摔坏
Hey, baby, I wish some bronc'd break my back

25
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,390
这样我就可以躺在床上一直干到中午了
so I could lay in bed all day bumping fuckin' uglies 'til noon.

26
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,890
听起来不错吧
Don't that sound nice?

27
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,460
-迟早啊  -不可能
- Just a matter of time. - It ain't happening.

百分百的事
It's one hundred percent happening.

瞧  凌晨三点看到这画面  辣不辣眼睛
See? This is how you get your eyeball poked out at three in morning.

30
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,950
工棚什么时候变成天堂岛了
When the fuck did the bunkhouse become Paradise Island?

31
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,210
博伊德  开什么玩笑
C'mon, Boyd. You've got to be kidding me.

32
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,640
她这个年纪都能投票  买子弹了
She's old enough to vote and buy bullets.

33
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,100
她眼光不好  你别怪我啊
Don't be blaming me for her bad judgment .

34
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,110
把这些绕桶赛手弄走
Get these goddam barrel racers out of here

35
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,900
免得整个工棚的人
before the whole bunkhouse is carrying

36
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,860
都拿着梳妆袋去竞技场
their groomed bag to the rodeo

37
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,140
像喂混蛋一样喂他们的香肠热狗
and feeding their sausage dogs like fucking assholes.

38
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,950
我们不是吃白食的
We're not freeloaders.

39
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,530
如果你想让我们工作  我们可以工作
If you want to put us to work, we can work.

40
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,940
吉米  精神点  你今天跟我走

41
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,410
把五岁的栗色马从马厩牵出来
Go get that 5 year-old sorrel out of that stall.

42
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,230
我来

00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,340
你带它去哪
Where you taking him?

44
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,900
我懒得用这匹马进行竞技比赛了
I'm tired of trying to ride the rodeo out of this son of a bitch.

45
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,680
我送它去汉密尔顿  它在那里想怎么弓背都行
I'm taking him to Hamilton. He can buck all he wants there.

46
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,850
我能去吗
Can I come?

47
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,390
不行  这不是公路旅行
No, it's not a fucking road trip.

48
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,950
他伤得太重  帮不了你
He's too busted up to help you.

49
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,930
我可以帮忙
I can help.

50
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,640
不用她  我只是
She doesn't have to do that. I'm just being...

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:50,480
那是谁  吉米
Who is that, Jimmy?

52
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,900
米娅  她是我女朋友
It's, uh, Mia. She's my girlfriend.

53
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,160
烦心事又来了
This is gonna be one of these fucking days, isn't it?

54
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,550
真是不想面对啊
I should have never got out of bed.

55
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:02,160
快上车
Go get your ass in the truck.

56
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,170
你们想听什么
What do y'all want to listen to?

57
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,810
空调
The air conditioning.

58
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,840

沉默寡言型  我喜欢
Strong silent type. I like it.

60
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,560
看来他用了狗
Looks like he used dogs.

61
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,650
用嵌板搭了条小路
Made an alley with panels.

62
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,280
看起来像母牛和小牛
Looks like cows and calves.

63
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,340
我打电话给销售谷仓
I'll call the sale barn.

64
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,820
你给小牛烙印了吗
Did you brand those calves yet?

65
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,790
耳牌
Ear tags?

66
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,080
没有
Nothing.

67
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,600
如果他够聪明  就会改了牛的烙印
Well, if he's smart, he'll change the brand on those cows

68
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,730
开车送去北达科他州
and drive 'em to North Dakota.

69
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,710
但他肯定想现在就卖掉那些小牛
But he's gonna wanna sell those calves right now.

70
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,090
莱恩  你负责三叉市的销售谷仓

你负责刘易斯顿  我负责比林斯
You take Lewiston, I'll take Billings.

72

我是牲畜委员会的亨顿探员
This is livestock agent Hendon.

73
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,060
我能和拍卖经理谈谈吗
May I speak to the auction manager?

74
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,460
没有找到更改约翰·达顿
There's no court filing that changes Power of Attorney

75
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,280
名下农场委托书的法庭文件
for the Dutton ranch for John Dutton.

76
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:22,470
那她就是利用舒瓦茨和梅耶公司的律师
Well, then she used Schwartz and Meyers attorneys

77
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,080
在盐湖城提交了
and they filed it in Salt Lake.

78
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,970
那在这里就无效了吗
Does that make it invalid here?

79
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,830
不是  但这样就把水搅浑了
No, but it does muddy the water.

80
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:33,100
对了  选举部门需要一份
Oh and, elections division needs a certified copy

81
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,440
你出生证明的核证副本
of your birth certificate.

82
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,800
好的  没问题
Okay, that's fine.

83
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,300
我不能签字  必须是你
I can't sign for it. Has to be you.

84
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,180
你在楼下就可以签字
They can get it for you downstairs.

85
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,280
能等到会议结束吗
Can it wait until after the meeting?

86
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,610
他们说必须存档才能批准你的任命
They said it must be on file to ratify your appointment.

87
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,810
我觉得他们想在会议前搞定
I think they want it done before the meeting.

88
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,100
好吧
Okay.

-我们不是换了  -是的
- Didn't we replace-- - Yep.

93
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,730
我会用双层玻璃
You know, I'd double pane that.

94
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,090
我也是这么想的
Was thinking the same thing.

95
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,100
好主意  伙计  英雄所见略同
Great minds, buddy. Great minds.

96
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,940
你最近好像经常这样
Seem to be doing a lot of that lately.

97
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,450
经常什么
A lot of what?

98
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,370
放空自己
Whole lot of staring into nothing.

99
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,370
我需要时间来做出决定
I have decisions to make that take time.

100
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,910
我得好好想想
Take a lot of thought.

101
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,880
这世界变化得太快了  亲爱的
The world just got a little too fast, honey.

102
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,380
我们得想办法让它慢下来
We need to find a way to slow it down.

103
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:43,050
世界好像并不会慢下来  爸
Not sure the world does slow down, Dad.

104
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,760
只要知道方法就可以
It does if you know how.

105
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,010
那我得好好学一下
You're going to have to teach me that trick.

106
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,730
你要嫁给他  是吗
You're going to marry him, aren't you?

107
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,730
也许吧
Maybe.

108
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,110
只要他向我求婚
If he asks me.

109
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,830
是的
Yes.

110
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,750
他不会的  亲爱的
He won't ask you, honey.

111
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,420
为什么
Why not?

112
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,350
不是因为他不想
Not because he doesn't want to,

113
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,550
而是因为他永远不会询问我的意思
but because he'll never ask me for your hand,

114
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,300
如果他不问我  就肯定不会向你求婚
and he'll never ask you without doing that.

115
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,070
因为他不想让我为难
He wouldn't want to put me in that position,

116
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,260
虽然我根本不会为难
even though he isn't putting me anywhere.

117
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,940
但他不会的  亲爱的  所以如果你想嫁
He just won't do it, honey, so if it's what you want

118
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,070
那你就得主动一点
you're gonna have to do the asking yourself.

119
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,410
你是说你不介意吗
Are you saying you'd be okay with that?

120
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,370
你是在问我的意思吗
Are you asking me to be okay with it?

121
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,960
他能娶我吗  爸
Can he have my hand, Daddy?

122
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,850
你爱他吗
Do you love him?

123
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,270
你开心吗
Makes you happy?

124
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,440
我对他一见钟情
Since the moment I met him.

125
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,620
既然这样
Well, hap--

126
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,830
你开心就好  亲爱的
Happy is all I've ever wanted for you, sweetheart.

127
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,960
只要他能让你开心  那你就嫁给他吧
You... Give him your hand if he gives you that.

128
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,510
谢谢你  爸爸
Thank you, Daddy.

129
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,350
对不起  贝丝
I'm sorry, Beth.

130
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,230
对不起什么
Sorry for what?

131
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,610
你觉得自己不能来找我
That you thought you couldn't come to me.

132
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,160
你以为我会觉得丢人
That you thought I'd be ashamed or

133
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,740
或者会因此惹上麻烦
you'd be in trouble for it or

134
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
随便你是怎么想的
whatever you thought.

135
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,890
你发生了任何事
I am the one safe person in this world

136
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,130
都可以来找我  贝丝
that you can turn to, Beth, for anything.

137
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,550
之前我没有让你感受到  我真的很难过
And it breaks my heart I didn't make you know that.

138
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,760
我现在知道了
I know it now.

139
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,180
当下才是最重要的
And now is all that matters.

140
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,830
你害我费了不少的劲啊
Boy, you made me work for this one.

141
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,860
是吗  为什么
Oh, yeah? How'd I do that?

142
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,530
你没告诉我你是领养的啊
You didn't tell me you were adopted.

143
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,910
因为我不是啊
Because I'm not.

女生把夹克当衬衫穿

185

你们仔细想想  当男人穿着
If you think about it, it's sexy when men wear

188
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,650
应该穿的衣服时就很性感
exactly what they're supposed to wear,

189
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,780
但对女生来说  穿不该穿的衣服才叫性感
but for girls it's sexy to wear what you're not supposed to wear.

190
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,780
我也搞不懂  为什么呢
I don't know. I wonder why that is.

191
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,890
可能是禁忌的魅力吧

一千块
Thousand dollars.

199
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,050
便宜没好货  好货不便宜  好吗
Hey, cool shit ain't cheap and cheap shit ain't cool, okay?

余生只能听一首歌
and could only listen to one song

204
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,520
你们会听什么
for the rest of your life, what would it be?

205
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,950
记住  那首歌会没日没夜地播放
And remember, that son of a bitch is gonna play

206
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:12,610
就像该死的暴风雨一样

我可以赤身裸体躺在沙滩上

210
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:23,120
听着这首歌  祈祷救援船永远也找不到我

她可不好对付
You have a tiger by the tail with that one.

我们等他能参加大赛再说

弓背挺厉害  里普  但这不是竞技马
He bucks pretty good, Rip, but he's no rodeo horse.

279
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,490
最多几千块吧
I'll give you a few grand for him,

280
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,030
这也是看在你的面子上

这样吧  我们可以继续驯它

284
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:20,210
直到它不再反抗  你觉得可以吗
'til he doesn't want to buck anymore if that helps you any.

我来处理吧  谢谢你  希德

287
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,740
他不想要那匹马吗
He didn't want the horse?

288
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,070
弓背还不够猛
Don't buck hard enough for 'em.

289
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,970
等等  他说那匹马弓背不够猛吗
Wait, he's saying that horse doesn't buck hard enough?

299
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,800
但他还是可能会死
And he could still die.

300
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,010
我希望你好好考虑一下
I want you to think about that.

301
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,010
你这是干嘛
What is this?

302
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,430
怎么  你这是在叫我别参加牛仔竞技吗
What, this is your way of telling me not to rodeo?

303
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,970
这是我告诉你不该参加竞技的原因
It's my way of showing you why you shouldn't.

304
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,890
你准备怎么办  吉米
What you do with what I show you, Jimmy?

305
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:42,190
就看你自己了  走吧
I'll leave that to you. Come on.

306
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,710
{\an8}冠军拍卖行

307
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,310
你见过他吗
You ever seen him before?

308
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,600
没有
No.

309
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,480
停车
Stop.

310
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,210
把车停好  不然我就把你拖着走
Put it in park or I'll drag you across the whole fucking state.

311
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,860
在比林斯的谷仓等我
Meet me at the sale barn in Billings.

312
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,030
我抓到他了
I got him.

313
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,490
是你一个人干的吗
Did you do this alone?

314
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,370
是的
Oh, yeah.

315
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,600
告诉我名字和地址
I want a name and an address.

316
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
如果你再骗我
And if you lie to me again,

317
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,060
我下手就不会这么轻了
I'm gonna stop hitting you and start beating you.

318
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,250
明白吗
You understand me?

319
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,380
嗯
Yeah.

320
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,370
医生又让你吃牛排了
Doc letting you eat steak again?

321
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,830
我健康状况良好  麦琪
Got a clean bill of health, Maggie.

322
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,820
我想吃什么就吃什么
I can eat whatever the hell I want.

323
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,340
还是三分熟吗
Still like it rare?

324
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,950
嗯  从冰箱拿出来
Yeah, just pull it out of the cooler,

325
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,910
小火烤一下  然后
whisper fire, and...

326
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,540
放进盘子里
put it on my plate.

327
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:08,730
我不相信巧合
I don't believe in coincidences.

328
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,400
你一点也不蠢
One thing you aren't is stupid.

329
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,340
可你竟敢再次踏入这个州
And you having the audacity to set foot in this state again,

330
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,070
更别说在我旁边的土地上工作了
much-less work on the land beside mine...

331
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:23,800
我猜你在监狱里的男朋友
My best guess is that your boyfriend in prison

332
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,330
把你的常识都操没了
fucked all the common sense right out of you.

333
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,060
你还有孩子呢  真不错  韦德
Nice to see you have a child who lived, Wade.

334
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,700
但他有你这么一个父亲
He sure drew the short straw

335
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,850
真是倒了八辈子霉
when it came to you for a father, though.

336
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,770
我给了你一份工作
I gave you a job,

337
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:56,080
一个你余生都可以称之为家的地方
a place to call home for the rest of your life

338
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,280
而你偷了一个牛仔不会偷的东西
and you stole the one thing a fucking cowboy doesn't steal.

339
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,700
现在你还敢来这里
And now you're here.

340
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,260
你也不傻啊
And you ain't stupid.

341
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,050
我来这里是因为我受雇于此
I'm here because I was hired to be here

342
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,370
你也不能事事都顺心吧
and you can not like that all you want.

343
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:10,830
也许这就是他们雇我的原因吧
Hell, maybe that's the reason they hired me in the first place.

344
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,250
只要你想和熊而不是幼崽摔跤
Anytime you want to wrestle a bear instead of a cub...

345
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,380
你可以选谷仓  约翰
you can pick the barn, John.

346
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,300
我在谷仓后面等你
I'll meet you behind it.

347
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,300
韦德
Wade.

348
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,390
你有属于我的东西
You have something that belongs to me.

349
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,520
来拿啊
Come and get it.

350
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,390
正有此意
I plan to.

351
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,820
真是操了
Oh, shit! Fuck.

352
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,280
今天真他妈倒霉
This fucking day.

353
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,360
喜欢跟我玩是吧
Want to fucking play games with me?

354
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,700
你他妈
You want to fucking...

355
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,740
他看起来好生气
He seems really mad.

356
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,960
这也太暴躁了吧
Like, I mean, wow, that is one mad fucking man right there.

357
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:10,040
我觉得还是坐在车里最安全
I think inside the truck is the safest place for us.

358
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,900
吉米  把马牵走
Jimmy, put that fucking horse away.

359
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:44,450
别怪我  我让你做了选择
Hey, don't blame me. I gave you a choice.

360
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,470
有种崩溃的前兆啊
This has a "first chink in the armor" feel to it.

361
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:17,610
好点了吗
A little better?

362
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:19,990
还没有
Not yet.

363
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,550
亲爱的  今天过的怎么样
So, dear. How was your day?

364
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,140
很有启发性
Well, my day was illuminating.

365
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,680
过来坐
Come sit with me.

366
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,660
这是什么
What's that?

367
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,050
正确的说法应该是毗邻
The proper term for it would be a juxtaposition.

368
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,470
我听不懂  贝丝
I don't know what that means, Beth.

369
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,390
我知道  宝贝
I know, baby.

370
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:30,100
瞧瞧
Look at that.

371
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,440
看起来像O型环
Looks like an O-ring.

372
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,980
嗯  你说对了一半
Oh, yeah. You're half-way right.

373
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,950
我觉得你不是喜欢钻石和黄金的"姑娘"
I didn't think you were a diamonds and gold kinda girl.

374
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,320
明白我的意思吗
Know what I mean?

375
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,700
嗯
Yep.

376
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,830
我不需要礼物  贝丝
Well, I don't need presents, Beth.

377
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,080
我只要你
Just you.

378
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,880
我就是这个意思
Well, that's what it means.

379
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,300
这意味着
It means that you...

380
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,420
我是你的人了
that you have me, that I'm yours.

381
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,470
这意味着"和我一起生活吧"
It means "come live your life with me,"

382
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,490
我只求你能活得比我久
and the only thing I ask is you outlive me

383
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,310
这样我就不用过上没有你的日子了
so I never have to live another day without you.

384
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:21,690
我可以试试
I can try and do that.

385
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,030
好吧
Okay.

386
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,030
就这么定了
It's settled.

387
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,120
我们结婚吧
We're getting married.

388
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,330
结婚
Married, huh?

389
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,130
是啊  宝贝  我在向你求婚
Yeah, baby. I'm asking you to marry me.

390
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,800
你愿意吗
Will you do that?

391
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,600
我
I mean, I...

392
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,560
我得问问你父亲
I would have to ask your father, though.

393
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,350
我已经摆平了
It's handled.

394
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,900
省得你尴尬
I spared you the indignity.

395
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:02,520
你意下如何
So what do you say?

396
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,740
我吧
I mean I...

397
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,780
其实我还挺喜欢钻石的
I woulda liked some diamonds, actually.

398
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,000
所以是同意了吗
Is that a yes?

399
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,800
贝丝  我不能去法院
Beth, I can't go to no courthouse.

400
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,260
这个星球上甚至没有我存在的记录
There's no record I even exist on this planet.

401
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,970
是啊
Yeah, well,

402
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,680
结婚证只是一份合同
a marriage license, that's just a contract.

403
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,400
好吗  只能算一笔生意
Okay? That's just business.

404
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,900
咱俩这不能叫生意
We ain't going into business together.

405
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,450
所以想跟我结婚
So marriage to me is...

406
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,620
就带我去那些山的脚下
you take me in front of those mountains.

407
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,710
在我家人和朋友面前
In front of my family. My friends.

408
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,670
我没有朋友  但如果我交了一个
I don't have any friends, but should I make one,

409
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,960
你就要站在我朋友的面前
you would stand in front of them

410
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,010
告诉他们  以后没有你我
and you would tell them there is no more you and I.

411
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:16,220
只有我们
There's only us.

412
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,730
没问题
I can do that.

413
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,150
-是吗  -是的
- Yeah? - Yeah.

414
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,880
-看到烙印了吗  -嗯
- See the brands? - I did.

415
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,520
牲畜委员会探员  开门
Livestock officer, open up.

416
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:22,900
开门
Open the door.

417
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,660
注意前门  我去后门
Watch the front. I'll take the back.

418
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:37,000
离墙远一点
Get off the wall.

419
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:40,120
-什么  -离墙远一点
- What? - Get off the fucking wall.

420
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,880
胸口对着墙
Turn your chest to the wall.

421
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,740
死不了吧
You gonna live?

422
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,620
这就是为什么我让你把胸口对着墙
That's why I told you to turn your chest to the wall.

423
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,700
如果击中你的侧身
If that had hit you in the side

424
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,260
我们就只能用铲子把你装进尸袋
we'd be scooping you into a body bag with a shovel...

425
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,750
说的可真他妈详细
That's... Pretty fucking descriptive.

426
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,710
-能起来吗  还没完事呢  -能
- Can you get up? We ain't done. - Yeah.

427
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:31,650
我想叫救护车  但我拿不到无线电  凯斯
I'd call for EMS, but I can't reach for my radio, Kacey.

428
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,260
没事  过来  过来  慢慢后退
It's okay, come here. Come here. Back slow.

429
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:39,280
调度中心  这里是110  情况紧急
Dispatch, this is one-one-zero, Code 3.

430
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,700
两名警官受伤  多处枪伤
Two officers down, multiple GSW.

431
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:44,120
派救护车和所有可用警力到我的位置

432
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,830
收到  110
Copy one-one-zero.

433
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:46,370
-你没事吧  -嗯
- You all right, man? - Yeah.

434
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,960
-别动  -如果位置有变  请提前告知
- Just stay still. - Please advise if your 20 has changed.

435
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,190
位置不变
Twenty is the same.

436
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,150
你总说凡事要讲真相
You always preached the truth.

437
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,660
你说这是男人的全部
You said it's all a man has.

438
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,910
男人的话
His word.

439
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,420
就是评判他的标准
Judge him by nothing else.

440
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,220
你自己有不同的评判标准吗
Are there different rules for judging you?

441
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,350
还是有我不知道的真相定义
Or is some other definition of truth that I'm unaware of?

442
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,700
你知道真相和它的含义
You know the truth and what it means.

443
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,350
我不知道真相
All right, I don't know the truth.

444
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,690
我只知道谎言
I just know lies.

445
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,940
我知道你每天都在骗我的谎言
I know the lie you told me every day of my life.

446
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,490
更糟的是  前提是还有更糟的话
And worse, if that's possible,

447
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,200
这还是你让我对你撒的谎
the lie you had me tell you.

448
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,790
我的一生都在撒谎
Every. Day. Of my life.

449
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,250
什么谎言  儿子
What lie is that, Son?

450
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:32,750
这个  这就是谎言
That. That's the lie.

451
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:38,220
你叫我儿子  你让我叫你父亲
You called me son, and you made me call you father.

452
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,550
坐下来
Sit down.

453
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,810
你不能再对我指手画脚了
You don't get to tell me what do to anymore--

454
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,350
那就滚出我家
Then get the FUCK out of my house.

455
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,480
你可以坐在我家客厅  也可以离开
You can sit in my living room or you can leave it.

456
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,440
这是你的选择
Those are your options.

457
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,880
公牛给母牛授精后  幼崽并不是它的儿子
When a bull breeds a cow, we don't call the calf its son.

458
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,020
公牛是雄性亲畜  幼崽是它的后代
The bull is the sire. The calf is its offspring.

459
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,130
仅此而已
That's all.

460
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,820
母牛是幼崽的母亲
The cow, well, she... she is the mother.

461
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,010
因为它养育  保护
Because she fed it. Protected it.

462
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:26,390
关心  爱护幼崽
Cared for it. Loved it.

463
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,620
它配得上母亲的称呼
She deserves to be called mother.

464
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,150
但是公牛
But the bull... He's...

465
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,730
它只是一头公牛
He's just a bull.

466
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,980
永远都只是一头公牛
That's all. And that's all he'll ever be.

467
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,700
你妈妈没有机会爱护你
Your mother never got a chance to love you.

468
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,790
你三个月大的时候  你父亲就用淋浴喷头
You were three months old when he beat her to death

469
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,290
把她打死了
with a shower head.

470
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,190
那个爱护你  养育你
The woman who loved you and fed you

471
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,180
保护你的女人是我的妻子
and protected you was my wife.

472
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,930
还有我
And me.

473
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,030
我保护你  教导你  指引你
I protected you. I taught you. I guided you.

474
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,120
我给予了你父爱和仁慈
I gave you love and kindness and everything your future

475
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,370
还有你未来注定要失去的一切
was guaranteed to be without.

476
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,440
你想怎么叫我都可以  杰米  但是
So you can call me whatever you want, Jamie. But

477
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,650
我还是会叫你儿子
I will call you son

478
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,320
因为我赢得了这个权利
because I have earned the right.

479
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,990
赢得这个权利是我这辈子最艰难的尝试
And earning it has been the hardest thing I've ever done.

480
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:28,870
你认识他吗
Did you know him?

481
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,870
我认识
Yeah, I knew him.

482
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,180
当他娶了你的生母
And when he married the woman who gave birth to you...

483
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:39,210
我们都求她不要这么做  因为我们知道结局
We all begged her not to do it because we knew.

484
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,610
但她可能以为自己能拯救他
But I guess she thought she could save him.

485
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,850
我不知道她一开始为什么要这么做
Why she wanted to bother in the first place, I don't know.

486
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,810
我不知道该怎么解释异性的吸引
I don't know how to explain the chemistry of attraction.

487
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,190
为什么它会驱使我们去做会害死我们的事
The thing that drives us to do the very thing that will kill us.

488
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:59,330
我没法跟你解释
I can't explain it to you,

489
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,490
因为我自己也不明白
because I don't understand it myself.

490
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,240
但你的处境很特殊  杰米
But you are in a unique position, Jamie.

491
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,300
几乎每个人都有过这样或那样的经历
Pretty much everyone at one point or another,

492
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,140
不管是生气还是好奇
whether just mad or curious,

493
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,750
都想知道换个父母的生活会有什么不同
wonders what life would be like with different parents.

494
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:21,300
但你真的有机会做出选择
You actually have the opportunity to choose.

495
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,650
你很神通广大  儿子
You're a resourceful man, Son.

496
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:27,180
如果他还活着  你肯定能找到他
So, if he's still alive I'm sure you can find him.

497
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,270
你可以看看他那颗黑心
And you can look into his black fucking heart.

498
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,400
他腐烂的
His rotten...

499
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,650
你可以看着他的眼睛做出选择  杰米
You can look into his eyes, Jamie, and you get to choose.

500
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,620
你可以选择叫谁父亲
You can choose who you call father.

501
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:57,130
靠  我累了
Goddamn, I'm tired.

502
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:02,210
在我的灵魂里  我仍然感到年轻
In my soul, I still feel young.

503
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:06,890
在这里  我感觉自己16岁
In here, I feel sixteen.

504
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,850
在我心里  我觉得
In my heart, I just feel...

505
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,060
太累了
so damn tired.

506
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,830
我从没想过在我还有力气的时候
I never thought I'd be tired of living

507
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:23,490
我会厌倦生活
while I was still strong enough to do it.

508
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,210
晚安  儿子
Goodnight, Son.
