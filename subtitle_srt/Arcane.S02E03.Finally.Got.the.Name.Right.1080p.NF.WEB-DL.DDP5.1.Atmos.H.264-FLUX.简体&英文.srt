1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,830
可是要记住 你姓吉拉曼恩
But remember: You're a Kiramman.

2
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,450
我会带突击队去底城完成三项任务
I will lead a strike team into Zaun with three objectives:

3
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,620
找到金克丝
Locate Jinx, 

4
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:28,990
摧毁微光
dismantle Shimmer,

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
铲除所有效忠于希尔科的残党余孽
and neutralize any agents still loyal to Silco.

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,370
裂沟工业的不断发展
The rise of industry in the fissures

7
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,830
也带来了越来越严重的毒气
has led to the air becoming increasingly toxic.

8
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,450
人们称之为“灰瘴”
They call it the Grey.

9
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:44,830
我已经着手派建筑师 设计了一套通风系统
I've instructed our architects to devise a ventilation system.

10
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,410
保证底城居民可以自由呼吸
The people of the underground deserve to breathe.

11
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,450
(金克丝)

12
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,540
人们称之为“灰瘴”
They call it the Grey.

13
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,870
{\an8}《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第三集

14
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,870
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

15
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,080
谢谢 我以为我死定了
Thanks. I thought I was a goner.

16
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,660
你是史密奇的人
You're Smeech's man.

17
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,790
以前是
Was.

18
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,290
现在不是了 我叫西诺特
Not anymore. Name's Heenot.

19
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,200
我...
I...

20
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,990
感觉自己也是时候该退休了
Oh, I decided it was time for me to retire.

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,120
应该是有人想要让你退休吧
Looks more like someone decided to retire you.

22
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,120
也对 我最不擅长就是审时...
Yeah, well, timing was never my strong...

23
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,830
抱歉 不好意思
Sorry. Sorry, it's... 

24
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,700
都是灰瘴 弄得我...
It's the Grey. It gives me the...

25
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,330
快说你是怎么进到这里的
Tell us how you wound up here.

26
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,660
等等
Hey, wait, wait.

27
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,870
是金克丝 要玩大的
Jinx is off the rails, even for her.

28
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,370
眼下她正在兴头儿上
She's got a real fire lit under her ass.

29
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,410
但这次真的有点太过了
She's planning something big,

30
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,200
她要对排风系统来个大改造
right here in the pipeworks.

31
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,200
这地方还挺大的 是吧
It's a pretty big place down here.

32
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,450
她往旧隧道那边去了
She was headed towards the old tunnels. 

33
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,750
说是要给排风口改改道
Something about rerouting the vents.

34
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,290
原来如此
This is it, then. 

35
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,370
- 铐上 - 为什么
Cuff him.

36
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,660
我该撂的都撂了
Hey, I told you everything I know.

37
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,950
可以算你是自首
You're a confessed criminal. 

38
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,620
好好在监狱里面过退休生活吧
You'll spend your retirement in a cell.

39
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,540
检查装备
Check your gear.

40
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,000
平日的训练就为今天
This is what we've trained for.

41
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,620
能聊两句吗
Can I get a minute?

42
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:56,080
第一次拒绝见你是因为不感兴趣
Your first request for an audience was uninteresting.

43
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,580
第二次是因为觉得你不够格
The second, inappropriate for someone of your station.

44
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,830
第三次
The third...

45
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,040
是懒得搭理你
plain annoying.

46
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,870
平时换别人早死八百回了
People have lost their heads for less.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,500
直说吧 阿玛拉
So tell me, Amara,

48
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,830
你这个皮尔特沃夫商会的人 想跟我谈什么
what does a member of Piltover's merchant guild want from me?

49
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,740
我不是为了商会的事来的
I'm not here representing the guild.

50
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,250
我是为了要追一笔债
I've come here to settle a debt.

51
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,040
管账的人在前厅呢
My bookkeeper is down the hall.

52
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,160
你偷走的东西
What you've stolen...

53
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,620
那可是千金难换的
...is more precious than any gold.

54
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,080
你真以为逃到皮尔特沃夫 就能摆脱我们了
Did you truly believe Piltover was beyond our reach?

55
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,290
我儿子已经死了
My son is dead.

56
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:59,540
难道他的死还不能让你们满足吗
Is that not enough to sate your bloodlust?

57
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,660
我可没把你当傻子看 安蓓萨
I haven't insulted your intelligence, Ambessa.

58
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:05,000
也请你别把我当傻子
Do not insult mine.

59
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,950
我们很清楚你在皮城想干什么
We know what you're chasing in Piltover.

60
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,830
我们不会让你得逞的
We will not allow it.

61
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,450
不让
Allow?

62
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,990
不劳大驾
Thank you.

63
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,040
你的到访倒是证实了我的猜测
Your visit only confirms my suspicions.

64
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,120
凭你个老巫婆还想阻止我
Try to stop me, insolent witch.

65
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,160
我的死活不重要
My death means nothing.

66
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,250
以前的恩怨 你早该放下了
You should have given up the feud.

67
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,450
你根本不懂家人对我来说意味着什么
You have no inkling what family is to me.

68
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,120
增加三倍守卫
Triple the guard.

69
00:06:57,910 --> 00:06:59,870
这事儿不会就这么完了
This will have consequences.

70
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,120
控制权要赶紧拿下
We need control now.

71
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,790
萨罗还没准备好
Salo isn't ready.

72
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:07,330
是不是可以考虑把梅尔拉进来
Perhaps it's time we involved Mel.

73
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,660
不行
No. 

74
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,540
必须跟她保持距离
We must distance ourselves.

75
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:12,540
做我们的敌人对她更安全
She's safer as our enemy.

76
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,660
萨罗我会摆平
I'll handle Salo.

77
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,870
这女的失踪的事瞒不了太久
Her disappearance won't go unnoticed for long.

78
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,870
我担心的不是这个
It's worse than that.

79
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,000
应该要让其他人按兵不动
We should cut the others loose.

80
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,000
听着 如果那个叫西诺特的 说的是真的
Listen, if that Heenot idiot is telling the truth,

81
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,200
那金克丝可是憋了个大招来对付我们
Jinx is gonna have surprises in store for us.

82
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,990
那更应该多带些人
All the more reason to bring backup.

83
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,450
只要察觉到他们的踪影
She'll smell their nerves a mile away 

84
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,290
她就会利用这一点来对付我们
and find a way to use them against us.

85
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,410
我说得不对吗
Tell me I'm wrong.

86
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,330
这次我不能再让她逃掉了
I can't let her get away again. 

87
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,410
- 你确定你准备好... - 我的妹妹
- Are you sure you're ready to...? - My sister is gone.

88
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,540
死了

89
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,620
她现在只是金克丝
There's only Jinx now.

90
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,870
这事儿也该了结了
It has to end.

91
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,620
你的母亲去世
I'm so sorry 

92
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,750
我也很难过
about your mother.

93
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,870
很抱歉 我什么都做不了
I'm sorry I can't bring her back, 

94
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,370
但是你能不能...
but please just...

95
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,790
我生命中的每个人都变了
Everyone in my life has changed. 

96
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,700
但是我希望你不要变
Promise me you won't change.

97
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,370
不会的
I won't.

98
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,160
出去
Out.

99
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,250
你该知道在这儿找到你 并不是件难事吧
Do you realize how easy it was for me to track you down here?

100
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,910
毕竟是我的地方
Well, I do own the place.

101
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,830
我对你仁至义尽了
It's enough work propping you up

102
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,290
为你花了多少心思 下了多少功夫
without you dulling what few wits are left rattling around in there.

103
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:01,740
你脑子里有数
If you propped 

104
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,910
是仁至义尽还是虚情假意啊
as well as you prod,

105
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,620
要不然我干嘛要在这儿费时又伤神的
maybe I'd have better uses for my time

106
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,370
坐等那个吉拉曼恩家的大小姐
than sitting around waiting for an update

107
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,500
在底城玩猫抓老鼠的最新战报
on Princess Kiramman's underground escapades.

108
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,790
即便她连金克丝的影儿都没见着
She's gotten no closer to Jinx.

109
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,370
也丝毫不影响她 成为大家眼中耀眼的新星
But that doesn't seem to steal the stars from anyone's eyes.

110
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,040
让一个小丫头在自己的地盘抢了风头
Perhaps if you hadn't let a child overpower you 

111
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,580
又怪得了谁呢
in your own chamber.

112
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,950
那个小丫头没什么
It's not the girl.

113
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,790
人们相信她是冲着她的姓氏
It's the name. It bewitches people.

114
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,160
你应该很清楚
You should know.

115
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,160
不然你认为梅尔凭什么能...
Do you really think Mel could have succeeded--?

116
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,830
再敢说我家人一句试试
Never speak ill of my family.

117
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,370
你到底来干什么的
Why are you here?

118
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,700
来给你醒醒神
To sober you up.

119
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,250
恭喜你成功了
Mission accomplished.

120
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,830
是时候了
It's time.

121
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,450
尽力把能召集的家族全部都召集起来
Rally every house and family with even a modicum of influence.

122
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,540
你能办得到吧
Can you manage that?

123
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,950
等等 真的吗
Wait. For certain?

124
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,290
可以 没问题 照你说的办
Yes, of course. Whatever you need.

125
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,580
另外还有一件事
There is another matter, 

126
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:12,250
就是你们商会的那个阿玛拉
concerning your guild merchant Amara.

127
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,540
好的
And, yes.

128
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,660
皇冠
Lift.

129
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,580
就是这样
Fantastic stuff.

130
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,950
我们又见面了 莱斯特
Good to see you again, Lest.

131
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,120
我不干了
I'm out.

132
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,750
对我来说监视一个 有怪癖的议员不是什么难事
Keeping an eye on a councilor with peculiar tastes doesn't rattle me.

133
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,870
不过那个女人...
But that woman...

134
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,240
你见到过我母亲
You met my mother? 

135
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,490
她想干什么
What did she want?

136
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,080
不知道 我被赶出去了
I don't know. They kicked me out 

137
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,160
什么都没有听到
before I could hear any of it.

138
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,450
听没听到 你我都很清楚
We both know you heard every word.

139
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,290
对不起 我真不能说
I'm sorry, but I really can't.

140
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,540
莱斯特 这件事至关重要
Lest, this is vitally important.

141
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,870
我必须知道
I need to know.

142
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,450
你的目标不是萨罗
This was never about Salo.

143
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,490
你在利用我去接近她
You're using me to get to her.

144
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,660
然后呢
And then what?

145
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,700
你事成之后会管我的死活吗
You take what you need, hang me out to dry? Hmm?

146
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,240
我就是牺牲品
I'm expendable?

147
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,410
不 没有人是牺牲品
No, no one is expendable.

148
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,580
我恰恰要避免这种事发生
That's what this is all about.

149
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,370
凡事一旦沾上我母亲 就都存在风险
Everything with my mother is a calculated risk.

150
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,790
我答应你护你周全
I'd love to promise your safety,

151
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,290
除此之外 我也无法再承诺其他的了
but I can't make any assurances other than this:

152
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,910
如果要是让我母亲得逞
If my mother gets what she wants, 

153
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,580
整个城邦都会遭殃
the whole city will suffer.

154
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,740
而眼下可以阻止她的人
And right now you're the only one 

155
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,830
也就只有你了
who can stand in her way.

156
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,330
他们要宣布什么重大决策
They're setting up some big announcement.

157
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:35,040
名门望族都会参与
All the who's who.

158
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,500
他们计划夺权 辅佐萨罗上位
Aiming to take over and put Salo in the hot seat, but...

159
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,700
不过谁在幕后操纵 大家都清楚
we know who's really pulling the strings.

160
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,410
还听见个名字 阿玛拉
I caught a name. Amara.

161
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,750
不知道你认不认识她
I don't know what you make of that.

162
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:49,370
给你 这是新配方 很受欢迎的
Here, brand-new cocktail. All the rage.

163
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,080
是用微光调配的
It's made with Shimmer.

164
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,620
会在身体上留下痕迹
Leaves traces on the body.

165
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,250
有了这个 你就能摆平萨罗了
That should be all you need to shut Salo down.

166
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,240
谢谢你
Thank you.

167
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,450
另外就是
For what it's worth...

168
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,540
你母亲就算再凶狠 也有忌惮的事情
dangerous as she is, your mother was spooked.

169
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,080
我能察觉到
I could smell it.

170
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,450
就像被逼到墙角的猫一样
Like a cat backed into a corner.

171
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,870
维克托曾推测
Viktor hypothesized 

172
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,410
也许有一种叫做“狂野符文”的东西
that there may be something he called "wild runes."

173
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,950
当我们的世界与奥术世界相邻的时候
Patterns that occur naturally

174
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,790
这种符文就能自然产生
where the border between our world and the Arcane is thin.

175
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,870
很像你用在海克斯科技上的
Runes like the ones you use in Hextech.

176
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,910
这种狂野符文和那些有什么不一样
What's the difference between those and wild runes?

177
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
把书递给我
Pass me a tome.

178
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,200
我用你能够听懂的表达
I used words you understood 

179
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,040
让你做出相应的行为
in order to elicit your action.

180
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,580
这就是海克斯科技符文
This is what Hextech runes are.

181
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,660
把书递给我
Pass me a tome.

182
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,870
把书递给我
Pass me a tome.

183
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,080
看 你叹气了
There, you sighed. Still a kind of language.

184
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,660
这也算是一种表达
A sound, 

185
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,080
无需文字的表达
but not words.

186
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,620
是原始的 自然的 这就是狂野符文
Something raw. Natural. That's wild runes.

187
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,660
奥术在大多数地方都处于休眠状态
Most places, the Arcane is dormant, but here and there, it's more active.

188
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,410
但在你我这里却异常混乱
Wild runes are...

189
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,330
就有点像是指纹
Sort of like its fingerprints.

190
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,240
没错
Exactly.

191
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,870
所以你是想说 我们树上出现了图案
So you're telling me that pattern is on my tree

192
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:29,200
是因为你们为了一己私欲 让奥术不爽了
because you pissed the Arcane off with all your demands?

193
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,910
我可不是这个...
That's-- That's not what I...

194
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,950
这小伙子没准说中了
Oh, the lad may be onto something. 

195
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:35,200
有因必有果
Every action sparks 

196
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,660
有果必有因
a reaction.

197
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,250
哎呀 没接住
Oh, ball sockets.

198
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,620
你觉得这是过度使用 海克斯科技造成的吗
Do you think this could actually be a result of overuse of Hextech?

199
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,950
说到法术创造奇迹这种事情
I've seen miracles spring from the hands 

200
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,410
我也见识过不少
of mages many times,

201
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,160
不过大多数结局似乎都不怎么好
but so often, they turned to horrors.

202
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,490
究其原因
I'd always presumed 

203
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,040
我一直觉得是因为人类 难以驾驭强大的力量所致的
it was due to mankind's... turbulent relationship with power.

204
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,240
但或许
But perhaps 

205
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,200
真正的原因其实 来自于奥术自身的属性
it is a property of the Arcane itself.

206
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,870
多年来
We tested 

207
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,040
我们在各种条件下测试海克斯科技
our Hextech under every conceivable condition for years.

208
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,160
如果真给什么地方带来了某些影响
If there's some reaction taking place,

209
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,240
那为什么以前一点迹象都没有
how come we've never seen any sign of it until now?

210
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,910
为什么又会出现在一棵树上
And why would it appear on a tree, 

211
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:19,200
而且还在地下
deep underground?

212
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,410
您消息可靠
Your source panned out.

213
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,660
我已经查过了
I've confirmed 

214
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,910
萨罗今天私下见了几个家族的成员
Salo met privately with members of several houses today.

215
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,750
我应该第一时间告诉您的
I should have been first to bring this to you.

216
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,660
我保证下次不会疏忽了
I promise I wouldn't have missed it.

217
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,040
他们真是好大的胆子
It's just such a bold move.

218
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,950
- 这个节骨眼上简直... - 愚蠢
- And at this moment, it's... - Foolish.

219
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,500
您的母亲自然不可能是愚蠢的
Of course, your mother is anything but a fool.

220
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,120
一定是我遗漏了什么线索
There must be an angle I'm missing.

221
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,790
那件事查得怎么样了
Did you look into the other matter?

222
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,660
关于您哥哥的死因
There's a rat's nest 

223
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,790
目前掌握的线索还不是很明朗
of misinformation surrounding your brother's passing.

224
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,040
跟他有过交集的人 身上都看不出什么问题
Whomever he crossed knows how to cover their tracks.

225
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,830
不过他们似乎快要 把您母亲的财产全部转移走了
Moreover, they've managed to strip your mother of most of her holdings.

226
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,080
她无路可退了
She's desperate.

227
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,660
这样的话只会让她变得更加危险
Which makes her all the more dangerous.

228
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,540
我们现在该怎么办
What are we going to do?

229
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,200
把药剂师叫过来
Summon the apothecary. 

230
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,580
让他帮我看看这个
I'll want his opinion of this.

231
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,790
再跟进一下阿玛拉那边
And check in on Amara.

232
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,250
这儿还是海克斯飞门吗
This is still part of the Hexgates?

233
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,000
我们现在少说也往地下降了60米了
We must be at least 200 feet below the surface.

234
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,080
整个结构就像一条通道
The entire structure is a channel,

235
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,750
将海克斯科技的能量聚成精密光束
focusing the Hextech energy into a precise beam.

236
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,410
凯特琳
Cait.

237
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,830
逮到机会你就...
If you see an opening...

238
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,330
直接开枪
take the shot.

239
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:47,910
蔚
Vi.

240
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,290
你对它的设计怎么这么了解
How do you know so much about its design?

241
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:08,870
大量的阅读和自己的推导
Read what I could, deduced what I couldn't.

242
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,080
不过没想到上城人会把 这么重要的东西放到地下
Plus, I didn't think the Topside would trust anything that important below the surface.

243
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,040
最起码海克斯宝石矩阵该被放在地上
I thought the gemstone mesh was installed aboveground.

244
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,740
矩阵的确是在地上
The mesh is aboveground,

245
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,200
但我们担心万一飞门超载
but we weren't sure what would happen if the gate overloaded,

246
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,240
于是就在底部安装了保险装置
so we installed a failsafe at the base.

247
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,040
所以万一有爆炸 也影响不到你们
So instead of it exploding in your neighborhood,

248
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,910
遭殃的只会是我们 对吧
it would blow up in ours.

249
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,490
这儿距离裂沟还远着呢
We're miles from the main fissures.

250
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,120
对 是还远着呢
These are the same utility ducts 

251
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,790
但这些管道跟我们底城的 供水管道和通风管道是相连的
that carry our water and facilitate our ventilation.

252
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,790
这就是为什么我们的树会受到影响
That would explain it affecting the tree.

253
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:49,790
真不可思议
Inconceivable.

254
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,160
真是
You know, 

255
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,250
嘴上说着我们应该同甘共苦
you say we should feel like we're all one people.

256
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,950
结果却成了一出事 就让我们底城人先顶着
But whenever it rains, we're the ones that get wet...

257
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,160
怎么回事
What the...?

258
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,160
金克丝
Jinx! Jinx! Jinx! Jinx!

259
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,040
可算把我名字叫对了
Finally got the name right.

260
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:15,500
为了找我 你还真是连个地缝都不放过呀
Guess there really isn't a crack in the earth where you won't find me.

261
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,740
这是什么地方
What is this place?

262
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,540
你还记得以前睡觉前
Don't you remember the old Janna bedtime stories

263
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,330
范德尔给我们讲过的迦娜的故事吗
Vander used to tell us?

264
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,950
矿工们被困在地下
Miners trapped underground.

265
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,950
呼吸越来越困难
Air running thin!

266
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,160
在这时
But then 

267
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,910
吹风的女人从天而降
some wispy wind woman wafts 

268
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:33,040
把大家都救了出来
to their rescue.

269
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,910
这么离谱的故事
Wild the kind 

270
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,450
不过是人们窒息的时候安慰自己罢了
of crap people get up to when you choke them out.

271
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,990
我们借助灰瘴清空街上的人
We used the Grey to clear the streets. 

272
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,080
是为了保证安全
To keep people safe.

273
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,330
“我们”
"We."

274
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,330
没想到我姐姐会披上上城那层皮
Never thought my sister would turn bluebelly.

275
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,500
没想到我妹妹会让 别的孩子也变成孤儿
Never thought mine would orphan kids.

276
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,620
那又怎么了
Ha! Why not? 

277
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,040
我现在谁的也不欠
Done it to myself enough.

278
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,700
不过把我的照片贴得到处都是
But plastering my face all over

279
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,250
是不是想让别人替你干那些脏活儿
so someone else would do your dirty work?

280
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,830
还往空气里下毒是吧
Poisoning our air?

281
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:08,330
你也变了不少啊 姐姐
You've turned a leaf, sister.

282
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,290
我受够了

283
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:11,500
我不想再拿你的错误来惩罚自己I'm done blaming myself for your mistakes.

284
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,620
我不想骗自己你还是我的妹妹
Done pretending you're my sister. 

285
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,040
你不是了
You're not.

286
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,950
是你杀了她
You killed her.

287
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,330
我不会再让你玷污我对她的回忆了
I'm not gonna let you stain her memory anymore.

288
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,830
那就阻止我
Then stop me.

289
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,910
反正我不管做什么
'Cause no matter what I do,

290
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,290
好像都死不了
I just can't seem to die.

291
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,910
对不起了
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,540
我也对不起了
I'm sorry too.

293
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,790
我就知道你们俩
I know you're sweet on her.

294
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,330
以后要是有机会
Hope you got a chance to, you know...

295
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,830
倒是可以...
Before...

296
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,660
动手吧
I'm ready.

297
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,290
那个是狂野符文吗
Is that a wild rune?

298
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,160
我也不知道它到底是什么
I have no idea what that is.

299
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,620
我们究竟做了什么
What have we done?

300
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,540
继续 来啊
Go on. I'm ready.

301
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,410
是你真好
I'm glad it's you.

302
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,330
就只能是你
Had to be you.

303
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,750
不要
No!

304
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,120
你干嘛
What are you...?

305
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,410
快放开我
Get off me.

306
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,740
快点让开
Get away from her.

307
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,620
- 凯特琳 - 让开

我不能看着你犯错
I shouldn't have had to.

318
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,830
我本来有机会的
I had the shot.

319

那只是个孩子 万一打偏了呢
That was a kid. What if you missed?

320

我一直告诉自己你们俩不一样

323
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,500
可我错了
But you're not.

324
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,540
你们俩果然是姐妹
It's her blood in your veins.

325
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,200

Then why are you the one acting like her?

326
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,500
依罗拉
Elora?

327
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,000

昨天我与你们商会的阿玛拉见过一面

商议如何重建城市

337

怎样让这座伟大的城市恢复往日辉煌

338
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,200
就在这时
when 

339
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,120
突然闯进来两个底城刺客

00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,290
可她还是丧了命

342
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,080
怎么能任由刺客的刀悬在心头
Our families should not need fear an assassin's dagger 

343
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,160
让大家夜不能寐呢
in the night.

344
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,040
是时候做个了结了

其家族始终拥护进步发展

并且还要善于运筹帷幄
Who may consider my experience

360
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:17,250
我以及我率领的 诺克萨斯部队都将听他调遣

361
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,120
只有这样
