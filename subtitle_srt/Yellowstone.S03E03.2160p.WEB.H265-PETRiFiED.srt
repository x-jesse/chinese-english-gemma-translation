早上好  爷爷
Good morning, Grandpa.

9
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,790
怎么了
What?

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,090
听
Listen.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,270
是头麋鹿
It's a cow elk.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,940
它在干嘛
What's she doing?

13
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,730
它很聪明
She's a smart one.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,560
我没看到它
I don't see her.

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:09,680
你看不到它的
You won't. You won't.

16
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,940
它把那只狼从孩子身边引开了
She's leading that wolf away from her baby.

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,790
它的孩子呢
Where's her baby?

18
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:19,520
躺在狼面前的灌木丛里
Laying in some sagebrush right in front of him.

19
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,580
当麋鹿还是幼崽时  它们没有任何气味
When elk are babies, they don't have any scent.

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,150
所以狼能找到幼崽的唯一办法
So the only way the wolf can find it

21
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,470
就是等它对妈妈失去信心  转而逃跑
is if it loses faith in its mama, makes a run for it.

22
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,340
我有点难受  孙子
I'm feeling a little sentimental, grandson.

23
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,570
我想看那只小麋鹿活下来
I'd like to see that little elk live.

24
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,240
我们帮它一把吧
What do you say we tip the scales in his favor?

25
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,290
跟在我后面  好吗
Stay right behind me, okay?

26
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:56,670
如果我们靠得太近  它就会跑向妈妈
We get too close, it'll make a run for its mama

27
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,460
那我们就帮倒忙了
and then we've screwed the whole deal.

28
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,880
我们怎么帮它
How are we gonna help it?

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,890
划出一小块领地  孙子
We're gonna mark a little territory, grandson.

30
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:08,950
来吧
Get to it.

31
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,560
就在一个地方吗
Just in the one spot?

32
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,580
随你  尽情地尿
Everywhere you can. Let her rip.

33
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:22,930
别尿我身上
Don't mark me.

34
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,790
泰特醒了吗
Is Tate up?

35
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,240
嗯
Yeah.

36
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,060
他在干嘛
What's he doing?

37
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,730
灌溉  他没事
Irrigating. He's fine.

38
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,560
回来
Get back in here.

39
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,590
嗯  这样
Yeah, well, that...

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,860
应该暂时能帮到它
that should fix him for a while.

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,640
我们现在干嘛呢
What should we do now?

42
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,510
我觉得
Well, I guess...

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,890
我们去看看牛吧
Guess we should check on the cattle.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,030
牛看起来挺好
Cattle look good.

45
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,780
检查完了吗
We done checking on the cattle?

46
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:12,930
是的
Yep.

47
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,300
现在干嘛
What now?

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,670
现在我们可以做任何你想做的事了
Now we can do whatever you want.

49
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,390
我不知道我想做什么
I don't know what I want.

50
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,500
我们散散步吧
Let's go on a walk.

51
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,720
好主意
That's a great idea.

52
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,750
我以为经营牧场挺难的呢
Thought ranching would be tougher.

53
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,560
这不算经营牧场  孙子
This isn't ranching, grandson.

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,020
这算是战利品
This is the spoils of it.

55
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,550
什么意思
What's that mean?

56
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,680
这就是我们经营农场的原因
It means this is the reason we do it.

57
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,810
经营农场
Ranching's a...

58
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,890
经营牧场可不好干  孙子
Ranching's a terrible business, grandson.

59
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,270
不好干  为什么
Terrible? How?

60
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,090
从何说起呢
Well, where do I start...

61
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,380
我们无法控制牛肉价格
We can't control the price of beef,

62
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,760
或者干草  拉牛去拍卖场的柴油价格
or hay, or the diesel it takes to take the cattle to auction,

63
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,340
或者喂牛的干草价格
or the hay out to the cattle.

64
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,010
联邦法规
There's, uh, federal regulations

65
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,710
州里的法规
and state regulations

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,950
县里的法规
and county regulations

67
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,370
市里的人还起诉我们
and these people in the city suing us,

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,210
抱怨我们没有好好饲养他们的食物
and complaining about the way we raise the food they eat.

69
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,120
还有什么
What else?

70
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,590
暴风雪和干旱
Then there's blizzards and droughts

71
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,040
一半的牛群想在河里自杀
and half the herd is trying to kill itself in the river

72
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,970
另一半在围栏上找漏洞
and the other half looking for a hole in the fence

73
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,640
这样就可以站在高速公路中间被车撞了
so he can go stand in the middle of the highway and get hit by a car.

74
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,180
或者走进森林
Or wander into the forest

75
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:49,060
被狼  灰熊
and get eaten by a wolf or a grizzly...

76
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,540
或者又大又臭的大脚野人吃掉
or a big, stinkin' Sasquatch--

77
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,030
大脚野人是什么
What the hell is a Sasquatch?

78
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,190
我也不知道
I don't know.

79
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,900
压根就没有大脚野人  对吧
There's no such thing as a Sasquatch, is there?

80
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,470
反正我没见过
Well, I've never seen one.

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,310
既然经营牧场这么难  我们为什么要经营呢
Well, if ranching's so hard, how come we do it?

82
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,580
这就是人生啊  泰特
Because it's one hell of a life, Tate.

83
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,450
这就是人生
One hell of a life.

84
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:16,660
{\an8}黄石
第三季  第三集

85
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,860
一旦人生想得简单点  真的很有趣
You know, when you boil life down, it's funny

86
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,850
每个人的需求并不多  不是吗
just how little you need, isn't it?

87
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:50,860
可惜再过几代就不存在了
It's a shame that in a few more generations this won't exist.

88
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,650
一百年来大家都这么说  贝丝
People have been saying that for a hundred years, Beth.

89
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,560
他们以为铁丝网会毁了边界
I mean, they thought that barbed wire was gonna ruin the frontier,

90
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,790
但是现在呢
but there it is...

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,660
边界就在我们周围
The frontier is all around us.

92
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,030
那不是边界  里普
That's not the frontier, Rip.

93
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,130
随你怎么说  但事实就是如此
You can call it what you want. But that's what it is.

94
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,220
我去上班了
I gotta go to work.

95
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,140
再见
See you.

96
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,800
你比看起来聪明
You know, you're smarter than you look.

97
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,420
话不多  但你很聪明
Not saying much, but you are.

98
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:38,820
你和看起来一样聪明  这就说明很多事了
Well, you're as smart as you look and that's saying a heap.

99
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,910
-检察长来了  -谢谢
- The AG is here. - Thank you.

100
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,770
你好  请坐
Hello, have a seat.

101
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,180
是好事吧
This should be good.

102
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,910
取决于你的观点
Depends on your perspective.

103
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,350
我刚和总统的幕僚长通了电话
I just hung up with the President's Chief of Staff

104
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,510
他们要任命里德女士为副检察长
and they're appointing Miss Reid to Deputy Attorney General...

105
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,670
美国副检察长  她才30岁
Of the United States. She's 30.

106
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,960
我知道
I'm aware.

107
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,210
他们要在华盛顿重塑形象
They're rebranding in Washington.

108
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,730
所以要找年轻人
They're looking for youth.

109
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,570
他们得逞了
Well, they sure got it.

110
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,620
我要任命一个临时工来主持特别选举
I need to appoint an interim and host a special election.

111
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,420
我还有三周就可以退休打高尔夫了  女士
I'm three weeks from the golf course, lady.

112
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,700
-不行  -我还有什么选择
- No. - What are my options?

113
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,170
你能在我摆平之前别退休吗
Can you please just stay on until I figure this out?

114
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,520
让他进来
Send him in.

115
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,770
现在你可以帮我解决下一个难题了
Now you can help me navigate this next quandary.

116
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,160
佩里州长  幸会
Governor Perry, a pleasure.

117
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,770
彼此彼此  这是斯图尔特检察长
Likewise. This is Attorney General Stewart.

118
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,330
埃利斯·斯蒂尔
Ellis Steel.

119
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,710
你好  请坐
Hi. Have a seat.

120
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,940
从何说起
Okay, where to begin...

121
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,410
你看过我们的提案了吗
You've looked over our proposal?

122
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,710
看过了
I have. Yes.

123
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,850
机场提案吗
This the airport?

124
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:04,970
你们要求州政府投资什么
What investment are you requesting from the state?

125
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,210
我们想要那块地
We want the land.

126
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:10,770
你们保留所有权  我们获得30年的租约
You retain ownership, we operate on a 30-year lease.

127
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,040
每个航空公司承担
The airlines are assuming construction costs

128
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,980
各自航站楼的建造费用
on their respective terminals,

129
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,760
我们会建造基础设施
we'll build the infrastructure,

130
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,230
合同管理和运营归州政府管
contract management and operations back to the state

131
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,520
原因很明显
for obvious reasons.

132
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,460
我们的建造成本刚过十亿
Our build costs are just over a billion.

133
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,730
我们想要四亿的土地
Now, we're looking for 400 million in land

134
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,050
以及十年五亿的税收补贴
and a tax subsidy of 500 million over ten years.

135
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,580
跟我说说数据
Talk to me about numbers.

136
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,490
公园每年大约有四百万游客
The park has roughly 4 million visitors a year,

137
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,330
多数人从杰克逊霍尔那边走
the majority flying or driving through Jackson Hole.

138
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,500
怀俄明州的科迪市车流量最大
Now, Cody, Wyoming sees the most automobile traffic.

139
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,670
我们觉得滑雪度假村开业后
We feel once ski resorts are operational,

140
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:45,700
机场每年可以接待两百万游客
the airport could see 2 million guests a year.

141
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,860
林务局同意租借度假村的土地了吗
Has the forest service agreed to the lease for the resort?

142
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,840
是的
They have.

143
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:53,930
12000英亩将分三个阶段开发
12,000 acres will be developed in three phases.

144
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,850
第一个度假村将在18个月后开放
The first resort will be open in eighteen months

145
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,750
三个度假村加在一起大约有两千张床位
with roughly 2000 beds available through our three resorts.

146
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,390
附属建筑
Ancillary building:

147
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:05,190
公寓  不属于我们的酒店
condos, hotels not under our umbrella,

148
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,280
延迟18个月到两年吧
those things lag by another 18 months to two years.

149
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,870
我担心的是
Well, here's my concern:

150
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,740
我觉得杰克逊霍尔
uh, I don't really look at Jackson Hole

151
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,570
本身的发展并不靠谱
as a model for responsible development.

152
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,880
你有价值数百万的二套房
You have multimillion dollar second homes

153
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,040
为当地人的生活定价
that are pricing the locals from living there.

154
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,650
杰克逊有多个卧室社区来接收无家可归的人
Jackson has multiple bedroom communities to absorb the displaced.

155
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,960
天堂谷没有这个
Paradise Valley doesn't have that.

156
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,650
利文斯顿可以开始发展了
Livingston is ripe for growth.

157
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,990
我们的城市规划师认为这座城市
Our urban planners feel the town could absorb 40,000 people

158
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,140
未来十年可以吸收四万人  它需要
in the next decade, and it needs to:

159
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,070
数百万美元的二套房交房产税
multimillion dollar second homes paying property taxes

160
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,630
而且无需额外的服务项目
into the community without drawing on its services

161
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,370
正是这个山谷所需要的
is exactly what this valley needs.

162
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,430
这些开发项目
And we're talking about between 3 and 6 billion

163
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:51,100
每年的税收收入可以达到30到60亿
in annual tax revenue generated by these developments.

164
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,910
你选好机场的位置了吗
Have you chosen a location for the airport?

165
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,910
一开始  我们以为天堂谷
Initially, we thought the golf courses

166
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,750
运动俱乐部的高尔夫球场可以重新利用
at the Paradise Valley sporting club could be repurposed,

167
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:05,490
但联邦航空局觉得那里的山谷太窄了
but the FAA feels the valley there is too narrow.

168
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,200
联邦航空局选择了这里
The FAA chose this location.

169
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:17,660
这片区域
This area here.

170
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,010
那是黄石
That's the Yellowstone.

171
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,030
那是传了七代的农场
That's a seven-generation ranch.

172
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,590
他不会卖的
He'll never sell.

173
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:27,240
那你就行使土地征用权
Then you'll invoke eminent domain.

174
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,730
试过了
It's been attempted.

175
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,130
他赢了
He beat it.

176
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,660
三百套公寓大楼
For a three-hundred unit condo complex.

177
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:36,220
这叫土地掠夺
That was a land grab.

178
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,550
七代农场主是否为经济发展
Did seven generations of ranchers infuse

179
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:41,780
注入了60亿
6 billion dollars into the economy?

180
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,930
这是发展  州长
That's progress, Governor.

181
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,540
发展是有代价的
And progress has a price.

182
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,090
凯特  可以取消我的午餐吗
Kate, will you cancel my lunch?

183
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,190
没问题
Absolutely.

184
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,400
我就知道你这笔钱花得值
I knew you'd be money well spent.

185
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,220
有什么发现
What do you got?

186
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,150
他们在建机场
They're building an airport.

187
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,380
他们是这么说的
So they say.

188
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:17,910
你知道在哪吗
Do you know where?

189
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,580
运动俱乐部
The Sporting Club.

190
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,460
不是运动俱乐部了
Not the Sporting Club. Not anymore.

191
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,730
操
Fuck.

192
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,010
关掉
Turn that off.

193
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,840
他见律师时才能关掉
Can only turn it off when he meets his attorney.

194
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,540
我是他的律师
I am his attorney.

195
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,850
三分钟后关闭摄像头
Shut camera in three.

196
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:06,910
什么鬼  杰米
What the hell, Jamie?

197
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:09,740
我只是照他们说的做了
All I did is what they told me to do.

198
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,240
你让我做的事  现在
What you told me to do. And now--

199
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,550
闭嘴
Shut the fuck up!

200
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,070
你到了以后
Now, you need to tell me exactly what happened

201
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,850
到底发生了什么事
from the moment you arrived.

202
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,890
绕桶赛小女孩
Little barrel racer girl,

203
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,470
她被打得半死
she was all just beat to hell.

204
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,000
警员把两个老男孩
And the deputies, they took these two old boys

205
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,160
关在马厩里
and they put him in a horse stall.

206
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,360
马厩里
In a horse stall.

207
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,590
不是巡逻车吗
Not the squad vehicle?

208
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,870
马厩里
In a horse stall.

209
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,310
让我给他们传递一个信息
And told me to send a message with 'em.

210
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,020
所以我们把他们扔进了受害者的拖车
And so we threw 'em in the back of the victim's horse trailer.

211
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:45,210
我开车带他们转了转
And I just drove them around.

212
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,080
我刹车踩得挺猛
And I worked the brakes pretty hard.

213
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,900
可能太猛了
Too hard, I guess...

214
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,230
谁把他们装进拖车的
Who loaded them in the trailer?

215
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,720
警员
The deputies did.

216
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,520
他们有没有可能在你去之前就被打了
Is there a chance that they were assaulted prior to your arrival?

217
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,640
不  我没看到
No, I didn't see--

218
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,400
有可能吗
Is there a chance?

219
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,670
当然  有可能
Sure. Yeah, there's a chance.

220
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,170
好
Yeah. All right.

221
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,270
你把他们装进了拖车
You loaded them in the trailer

222
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,940
因为你的车装不下两个罪犯
because your vehicle cannot accommodate two perpetrators.

223
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:27,040
他们告诉你还有其他的马被偷了
They had indicated to you that there were other horses stolen.

224
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:29,160
所以你把他们装进了拖车
So you loaded them in the trailer

225
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,060
这样他们就能带你找到被偷的马
so they could lead you to the location of the stolen horses.

226
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,840
-你是说  -听着
- Are you telling me-- - Listen.

227
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,470
当你开到这个地点时
While driving to this location

228
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:38,210
有一辆车停在你前面
another vehicle pulled in front of you

229
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:41,000
所以你为了保护你们三个人
so you were compelled to make a defensive move

230
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,020
不得不采取防御性措施
for your safety and the safety of the two men in your custody.

231
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,940
避免了事故后
After avoiding the accident,

232
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,230
你查看了被告
you checked on the accused

233
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,960
发现他们已经伤重身亡
and you realized they had succumbed to the injuries

234
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,510
因为他们之前被警员关在游乐场的马厩里揍了一顿
sustained by the deputies in the horse stall at the fairgrounds.

235
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,700
你记得我跟你说过的事吗
Do you recall the events I am repeating to you?

236
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,400
事情就是这样
That's what happened.

237
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,530
就是这样
It was just like that.

238
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,820
印在你的脑子里
Burn it in your fucking brain.

239
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,920
我不是在船上就是在河里
I'm either on a boat or in a river

240
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:37,870
或许我只是不想和你说话  祝你生活愉快
or maybe I just don't want to talk to you... Have a blessed day.

241
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,060
生活愉快
A blessed day.

242
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,070
臭傻逼
Fucking douche.

243
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,140
我可真容易被暗杀
I'd be easy to assassinate.

244
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,580
别勾引我
Don't tempt me.

245
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,200
我没有非法入侵
I'm not trespassing.

246
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,300
这不是我们的土地
It's not our land.

247
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,640
你也不是第一次了
It's not the first time you've done that.

248
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:29,660
我20岁时就尝试过所有的事了
You know, I ran out of things to do for the first time when I was 20.

249
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,650
我都有画面感了
That paints quite a picture.

250
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,890
你回头可以用来打飞机
Yeah, feel free to beat off to it later.

251
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,240
我在说啥呢
But who am I kidding,

252
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,380
你只能对着镜子打飞机  对吧
you only do that in front of the mirror, right?

253
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,020
-光线必须合适  -猜到了
- Only if the light's right. - Yeah, I figured.

254
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,530
你他妈要把机场建在哪里
Where the fuck are you putting that airport?

255
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:45,980
我说过了  我不参与日常
I told you, I'm not involved in the day to day--

256
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,850
扯淡
Bullshit.

257
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:50,300
我每天都开过这条路  你从来没出现过
I drive this road every single day, you're never here.

258
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,760
现在律师们和州长坐在一起
And now you're here every day

259
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,800
决定没收哪些财产时
while attorneys sit with the governor

260
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,970
你却每天都来这里
to decide what properties to condemn.

261
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,100
贿赂州政府官员获取情报可是重罪
You know, paying state officials for information is a felony.

262
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,020
你没干过吗
You've never done it?

263
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,210
我在尽我所能地赚钱
I've done about all you can do to make money.

264
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,290
你也一样
So have you.

265
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,890
你毁了很多公司  家庭和工作
You have broken companies, ruined families, ended careers

266
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,870
现在你却站在那里
and now you stand there

267
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:14,980
瞪着一双大眼睛盯着我
looking at me with those big, mad eyes

268
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,480
仅仅是因为别人也这样对待你了
because someone's doing it to you.

269
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,720
我们要做的
And all we're going to do

270
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,740
是让他成为蒙大拿最富有的人之一
is make him one of the richest men in Montana.

271
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,450
悲剧啊
Oh, the tragedy.

272
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,480
这不是他想要的  他想要土地
It's not what he wants. He wants the land.

273
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,990
你知道永远不会失去土地的诀窍吗
You know the trick to never losing your land?

274
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,860
找块没人想要的土地  这是唯一的办法
Find land no one else wants. That's the only way.

275
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,000
我会阻止你的
I'm gonna stop you.

276
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,760
怎么阻止
How?

277
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,200
再移一条河吗  贝丝
You gonna move another river, Beth?

278
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,250
我们会移回去的
We'll just move it back.

279
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:43,370
我们都不想在法院待上一年
None of us want to spend a year in a courthouse

280
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,440
但我们会的
but we will.

281
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,020
我们承担得起
We can afford it.

282
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,990
你呢  贝丝
How about you, Beth?

283
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,390
你家人承担得起吗
Can your family afford it?

284
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,720
你能抵挡我们进军的军队吗
Can you afford to fight the army we'll march in there?

285
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,580
给我们一个提案
Make us a proposal.

286
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,240
不要亏待你的家人
Make it very fair to your family.

287
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,430
我们不想打仗
We'd prefer to avoid a fight.

288
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,920
但我们也不怕
But we aren't scared of one either.

289
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,670
县检察官兰迪·哈珀要见达顿委员
County Attorney Randy Harper to see Commissioner Dutton.

290
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,170
-他在等你  -嗯
- He's expecting you. - Yeah.

291
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,400
你挺有种啊  把我叫到你办公室
You got a lot of fucking balls summoning me into your office--

292
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,540
你他妈疯了吗
Are you out of your fucking mind?

293
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,160
我才被你搞疯了  我得出庭作证
Out of my mind is me testifying in court,

294
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,980
你打给我了一通电话
to the phone call you made to me

295
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,080
让我派一名探员去攻击在押人员
asking me to send an agent to assault detainees.

296
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:47,740
什么电话
What phone call?

297
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,050
我录下来了  你个混蛋
The one I recorded, you asshole.

298
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,930
你以为这是我的爱好吗
Think this is my fucking hobby?

299
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:56,300
我的探员被派去抓两名袭击者
An agent of my office was sent to retrieve two assailants

300
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,870
他们被带上车时  身上明显有你的手下
who had visible marks on them when loaded onto a vehicle

301
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,280
殴打的痕迹
by your deputies--

302
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:05,090
我的探员有权把那辆车作为证据
a vehicle my agent had every right to hold as evidence.

303
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,510
只要你的探员背了黑锅
If your agent takes the fall for this,

304
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,390
我们就安全了
we're all clear.

305
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,110
可不嘛
Yeah, sure.

306
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:18,470
只要他在监狱里度过余生
I guess all he has to do is spend the rest of his life in prison

307
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,860
他的妻子和两个孩子
while his wife and two kids

308
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,550
在贝尔格莱德流浪就可以了嘛
rot in some fucking single-wide in Belgrade.

309
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,340
你愿意说服他吗
You want to pitch him that idea

310
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,270
还是你闻到
or are you starting to smell the reek

311
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,440
和州检察官达成豁免协议的臭味了
of an immunity deal with state prosecutors?

312
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,080
我只是让你给他们一个教训
I just told you to teach them a lesson.

313
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,760
没错  兰迪
Yeah, you sure did, Randy.

314
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,750
你是这么说的
I mean, that's exactly what you said.

315
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,840
嫌犯是本地人吗
Are the perps local?

316
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,060
一个来自路易斯安那州
One's from Louisiana,

317
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,500
一个来自密苏里州
one's from Missouri.

318
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,660
最后的地址是北达科他州的一个石油营地
Last known address is a oil camp in North Dakota.

319
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,310
把他们标记为无名氏
Toe tag them as John Does,

320
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,140
就说他们是被你的人从排水沟的卡车里拖出来的
say your deputies pulled them from a truck

321
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,520
体内的酒精浓度是法定标准三倍
in a bar ditch with three times the legal limit of alcohol in their system.

322
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,180
那受害者呢
What about the victim?

323
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,530
她什么都看见了
She saw everything.

324
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,550
好快啊
That was quick.

325
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,190
治安官说还需要一段时间
Sheriff said they'd need it for a while.

326
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,250
没有卡车和拖车  她还怎么表演
How can she rodeo without a truck and trailer?

327
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,260
我就是这么说的
That's what I said.

328
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,060
但他们说需要
But they said they needed it for...

329
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,800
需要什么
For what?

330
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,040
好像有个警员对那些混蛋下手太狠了
Guess one of the deputies took it too far with those assholes.

331
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,220
不是警员
Not one of the deputies.

332
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,380
我说的话会让我的探员坐牢
What I'm telling you could put my agent in prison.

333
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,820
我也可能因此坐牢
It could put me in prison, too.

334
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,050
那你还是别说了吧
Maybe you shouldn't tell it.

335
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,840
我姐也曾被打得奄奄一息
My sister was beaten to within an inch of her life.

336
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,810
他们做的其他事  我不能说
Whatever else they did... I can't say.

337
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:23,880
她也不会说
She won't either.

338
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,640
但我可以说
But I can say this:

339
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,730
敢碰我家人的人
a man who puts a hand on a member of my family

340
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,310
就别想再碰其他东西了
never puts a hand on anything else.

341
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,310
她只是挨了打吗
Is a beating all she got?

342
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,140
我也不知道
I don't know.

343
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,520
她不肯说
She won't talk about it.

344
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,810
我有点想拿着猎枪站在法院外面
I got half a mind to stand outside the courthouse with a shotgun

345
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,940
等着那些混蛋被保释出来
and wait for those sons of bitches to get out on bail.

346
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,990
你不用这么做
You don't have to do that.

347
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,070
大家都这么说  但是
Everyone says that, but...

348
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,000
他们的女儿又没有被打的鼻青脸肿
everyone's daughter isn't beat to shit

349
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,900
谁知道还发生了什么事
and God knows what else.

350
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,080
所以不要教我该怎么做
So don't tell me what to fucking do.

351
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,360
她不是你女儿
It ain't your daughter.

352
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:15,050
我没有教你该怎么做
I'm not telling you what to do.

353
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:20,210
我是说你不用这么做
I'm saying you don't have to do that.

354
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,300
80年前我们可以把他们吊在树上
Eighty years ago we could've hung them from a tree.

355
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,450
但今天
But today...

356
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,880
我能做的只有这么多了
this is the best I can offer.

357
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,910
我可以保证
I can promise this:

358
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,990
他们不会被传讯了
they're never getting arraigned.

359
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,640
你应该竞选州长
You should run for governor.

360
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,130
还是先说今天的事吧
Let's just focus on today.

361
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:53,250
你这么做是为了我吗
You did that for me?

362
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,340
我这么做是为了
I did that for every father

363
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,040
不让爱女心切的父亲犯错
who would be sacrificing their family if they did it.

364
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:05,480
他们没了
So they're gone.

365
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,190
他们完蛋了
They're done.

366
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,100
我不认识你  先生
I don't know you, sir.

367
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,050
我这么做说明我很信任你
And I'm showing you a lot of trust.

368
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,170
希望你也可以展示一下你的诚意
I need you to show me the same.

369
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,250
我想澄清一下这意味着什么
I just want to be clear about what this means.

370
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,280
你说得很清楚了
You've been plenty clear.

371
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,950
这样你就变成从犯了
This makes you an accessory.

372
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,740
你女儿要明白这一点
Your daughter needs to understand that.

373
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,980
我女儿一个字都不肯说
My daughter won't say a word

374
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,360
我恨不得亲手杀了他们
and it makes me more than that.

375
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,060
别担心
Don't worry about this:

376
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,780
地一干  什么都没发生过
soon as the grounds dry, it never happened.

377
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,850
但你我之间
But between you and me--

378
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,340
你肯定会需要帮助
time'll come you'll need a favor

379
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,020
我已经等不及了
and I can't wait to give it.

380
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,410
我可能真的需要你的帮助
I might ask for it.

381
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:36,320
凯特  帮我接通约翰·达顿
Kate, get me John Dutton on the line, please.

382
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,280
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

383
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,500
直接转到语音信箱了
It went straight to voicemail.

384
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,010
-试试杰米  -好的  女士
- Try Jamie. - Yes, ma'am.

385
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,410
我把他接进来
I'm putting him through.

386
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,740
-杰米  -州长
- Jamie? - Governor.

387
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,350
有什么事吗
What can I do for you?

388
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,280
我想和你们爷俩坐下来谈谈
I need to sit down with you and your father.

389
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,850
好的
Oh, okay.

390
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:02,860
你能说一下我们要讨论的大致内容吗
Can you give me the broad strokes of what we'll be discussing?

391
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,750
抱歉  今天没有大致内容
Sorry, no broad strokes today.

392
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,010
我们什么时候能见面
When can we meet?

393
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,500
州长  我能明天再打给你吗
Actually, governor, can I get back to you tomorrow?

394
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,510
咱们明天必须见面
This meeting has to happen tomorrow.

395
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,250
我们没有时间了
Time is not on our side.

396
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,650
那我明天一早就给你打电话  谢谢
I'll get back to you first thing, then. Thank you.

397
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,550
你跟谁说了吗
Did you talk to anyone?

398
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,460
没有  我照你说的做了
No, I did everything the way you said to do it.

399
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,710
有什么问题吗
Is there a problem?

400
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,150
我也不知道
I don't know.

401
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,720
杰米  如果有什么问题  我必须得知道
Jamie, if there's a problem I need to know about it--

402
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,270
没有问题
There's no problem.

403
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,110
现在谎言就是真相
The lie is the truth now.

404
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:42,620
谎言就是真相  永远的真相
The lie is the truth and it is the truth forever.

405
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,750
明白吗
Do you understand me?

406
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,350
你只能靠自己了
You're on your fucking own with this.

407
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,180
你自己编造真相吧
Make up your own truth.

408
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,780
靠
Shit!

409
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,320
兰迪
Randy?

410
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,570
操
Fuck!

411
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,360
你觉得怎么样
Well, what do you think?

412
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:18,430
我们几年前就该这么做了
We should have done this years ago.

413
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,680
我们可以在这里放小公牛放到12月
We can run stockers out here 'till December.

414
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,150
那是你的新员工吗
That your new hire?

415
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,440
是的
Yes sir.

416
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,930
她怎么上去的
How did she get up there?

417
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,440
靠  我也不知道
Shit, I haven't figured that one out yet.

418
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,430
她像甲虫一样爬了上去
She ran up it like a damn beetle.

419
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,580
开了眼了
Never seen anything like it.

420
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,440
科尔比  几点了
Colby, what time it is?

421
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,660
吉米  太阳在你正上方
You know, Jimmy, when the sun's directly above you,

422
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,540
你觉得现在几点了
what time do you think that is?

423
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,360
吉米  你要去哪里吗
Jimmy, you got somewhere you need to be?

424
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,740
不是  利文斯顿的资格赛3点开始
Oh, no, it's just the qualifier in Livingston starts at 3.

425
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,660
如果弄完了  我可以
So if we're done here, is it okay to...?

426
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,300
怎么了  我付你的钱不够吗
What's the matter, I don't pay you enough?

427
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,380
不是
No, sir.

428
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,670
不  我在存钱
No, I just been saving it up.

429
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,950
我终于有钱办职业卡了  所以
Finally got enough to get my pro card, so...

430
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,800
今晚是我的第一场排位赛
Tonight's the first rodeo that counts toward my standings.

431
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,580
这种谋生方式太难了  吉米
It's a rough way to make a living, Jimmy.

432
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,450
要是骑烈马摔断胳膊  就很难
You break an arm chasing buckles, it's hard to...

433
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,690
很难继续打工了
it's hard to stay on any man's payroll.

434
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,560
明白
Yes, sir.

435
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,780
麻烦来了
Here goes the day.

436
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,090
州长要见我们
Governor wants to see us.

437
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,460
你是说州长想见你吧
You mean the Governor wants to see you.

438
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,240
我正在享受退休生活
I'm retired. And enjoying it.

439
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,800
她说的是我们俩
She said both of us.

440
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,250
我可以让直升机过来
I can bring the chopper out here.

441
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,060
一小时就能到海伦纳
We can be in Helena in an hour.

442
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,570
听起来很严重
Sounds important.

443
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,140
的确
Sounds like it.

444
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:49,390
如果真有那么严重  她应该来见我
If it's that important, she shouldn't mind coming to see me.

445
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,130
我在利文斯顿的牛仔竞技赛等她
And I'll be at the rodeo in Livingston.

446
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,060
我们可以回来
Well, we can get back by--

447
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,800
我说了我在牛仔竞技赛等她
I said I'll be at the rodeo.

448
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:01,280
我相信她的选民会很高兴看到她
I'm sure her voters would enjoy watching her

449
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,140
参与他们真正在乎的事情
partake in something they actually care about.

450
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,800
里普  决定一下今晚谁看牛群
Rip, decide who's stayin' with the herd tonight.

451
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,010
我就穿这身进城  我们
I'm gonna take this outfit to town and we're, uh...

452
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,680
我们去看吉米竞技表演
we'll go watch Jimmy rodeo.

453
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:22,070
好的  泰特
Okay. Hey, Teeter.

454
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,860
你今晚看牛群
You're with the herd tonight.

455
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:31,340
科尔比  你陪着她
Colby, you stay with her, too.

456
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,780
我怎么能阻碍你和自然的亲密接触呢  科尔比
Who am I to come between you and nature, Colby?

457
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,870
快问快答  谁在上面
Hey, real, quick, who's on top?

458
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,300
应该很明显吧
I don't think there's any debate about that.

459
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,230
我们去收拾一下进城

我希望你们俩
You know, I want both of you to just drop dead

463
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:47,940
立刻在我面前死去
right in front of me right now.

464
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,120
这是我的梦想
That would be a dream.

465
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:52,170
你很快就会有一个新梦想了
Oh, I think you're gonna have a new dream in a little while.

466
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:53,920
玩得开心
All right, you all have fun.

467
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,360
照顾好我们的朋友  好吗
And take care of our friend, okay?

468
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,340
慢慢来  他是个浪漫主义者
And go slow, he's a romantic.

469
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:01,260
你看起来像只拔了毛的鸡

谢谢  别掉下来了

00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,840
她的嘴真不饶人啊
That one's got a real mouth on her.

473
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,800
我喜欢她
Yeah, I like that girl.

474
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,580
大家是不是都觉得我是山谷里最蠢的人
I guess everyone thinks I'm the dumbest man in the valley.

475
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,240
你可以握着她的手  里普
You can hold her damn hand, Rip.

476
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,670
谢谢爸爸
Thank you, Daddy.

477
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,160
我的牧场还能有我不知道的事么

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,060
无名小孩
Kid drew No Name.

480
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:51,240
靠  那匹烈马太牛逼了
Oh, shit. That's a nasty bronc there.

481

去年那家伙在全国牛仔竞技赛出场了十个回合
That son of a bitch last year bucked ten rounds at the NFR

482
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,270
所有人都被甩下来了
and he threw every one of them in the dirt.

483
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:00,430
一匹价值十万的烈马啊
A hundred thousand dollar bucking horse, right there, probably, huh?

484
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,950
让他一定要专注
Better get his head in the game.

我可不是这样的人  莉奈儿
Well, never my goal, Lynelle.

530
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,970

莉奈儿  这就是问题的好处
Come on, Lynelle, that's the one good thing about problems:

540
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:14,780
明天问题依然存在
they'll still be problems tomorrow.

541
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,640
你能给我讲讲你淫笑背后的计划吗
You want to walk me through the plan behind that dirty grin?

542
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:23,470
那要看情况了
Well, that all depends.

543
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,410
什么情况
On what?

544
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,680
你的安保人员有多少
On how big your security detail is.

545

你接受这个答案
You agree to the solution,

549
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,550
我们就可以装一整晚的青少年
and we can play teenager for the remainder of the night.

550
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:59,560
好吧  答案是什么
All right. What's the solution?

551
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,840
我任命杰米为临时检察长
I appoint Jamie interim Attorney General

552
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,360
杰米任命一个人
and Jamie appoints a person of your choosing

00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:09,510
管理牲畜委员会
to run the Livestock Commission.

554
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,690
出事了
Something happened.

555
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,800
我的提议对本州最有利吗
Is what I'm proposing best for the state?

556
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,840
我也不知道
I don't know.

557
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,540
对你最有利吗  是的
Is it best for you? Yes.

558
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,970
对山谷的人最有利吗
Is it best for the people in this valley?

559
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,610
应该是的
I... I think so.

560
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,100
我心里真的这么想
In my heart, I think it is.

561
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,370
我们这么做的目的是什么
And we do all this with what goal in mind?

562
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,290
协商一个可以接受的投降
To negotiate an acceptable surrender.

563
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,770
我们要放弃什么
What are we surrendering?

564
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,560
你想去河里裸泳吗
You wanna go skinny dipping down in the river?

565
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,490
不想

566
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,590

00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,300
不用了  谢谢
I don't. Thanks.

那你能帮我背部按摩吗
You wanna give me'un?

569
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,290
不能
No, I don't.

570
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,900
靠  你不喜欢女孩  对吧
Shit, you don't like girls, do ya?

571
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:20,560
我猜你肯定想暴操我海报上的男孩吧
Bet you want to pile drive one of them boys in my posters, don't ya?

572
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,340
不  我不想暴操你海报上的男孩
No, I don't want to pile drive one of the boys in your poster.

573
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,480
扯淡
Bullshit.

574
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,400
别这样  好吗
Can you not?

575
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:29,940
没事的  宝贝
It's all right, baby.

576
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,460
下一个到吉米了
Jimmy's next.

577
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,030
问题有很多
The problem-- there's plenty--

578
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,520
但最大的问题是
but problem number one is:

579
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,290
我找不到人替代杰米
I don't have anyone to replace Jamie.

580
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,270
那位战争英雄呢
What about the war hero?

581
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:30,130
问过了  他不愿意
Already asked him. He won't do it.

582
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:34,770
你这辈子从没询问过任何人
You've never asked anybody for anything in your life.

583
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,280
你只会下命令
You tell.

584
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,580
我可以去问他
I'll ask him.

585
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,630
他不会拒绝的
And he won't say no.

586
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,600
前提是你愿意
If that's what you want for him.

587
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,340
这是我一直以来对他的期望
It's all I've ever wanted for him.

588
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:50,820
那就让我在药片上加点糖
Then let me put a little sugar on this pill.

589
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,630
约翰·达顿承认他不是全能的了
John Dutton admitting that he can't do everything.

590
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,840
我可没有承认
I admitted no such thing.

591
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,880
孩子  加油  吉米
Okay, come on, kid. Come on, Jimmy.

595
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,940
不不不
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
