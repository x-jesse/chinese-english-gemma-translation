1
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,200
等等
Wait!

2
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,990
我只想跟你谈谈
I just wanna talk to you.

3
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,450
赶紧走吧 艾克
Get out of here, Ekko.

4
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,790
我只想...
I just...

5
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,660
我只想跟你谈谈 爆...
I just wanna talk to you, Pow--

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,160
金克丝
Jinx.

7
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,450
来不及了 艾克
You're too late, Ekko.

8
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,830
等等
Wait!

9
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,660
这节奏我跟不上了
Always a dance with you.

10
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,200
不过我得稍微坐一会儿 缓一缓
I think I'm just gonna sit here a minute.

11
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,200
让我先喘口气
You know, catch my breath.

12
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,700
看看有什么办法 能劝我的老朋友别炸死我俩
See if I can talk an old friend out of blowing us up.

13
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,120
我不想再说了
I'm tired of talking.

14
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,290
不要
No! No! No! No...

15
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,950
以前我认识的一个人
You know, I learned from someone...

16
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,000
她很特别
very special...

17
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,290
她说过去的事 就让它过去 不要纠结
that no matter what happened in the past,

18
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,700
重新开始永远都来得及
it's never too late to build something new.

19
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,250
总有人值得这么做
Someone worth building it for.

20
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,370
{\an8}《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第九集

21
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,370
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

22
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,540
我需要你和执法官 尽量为我多争取一点时间
I need you and the Enforcers to buy me as much time as you can

23
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,290
确保我可以关闭海克斯飞门
so I can shut down the Hexgates.

24
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,540
机会只有一次
It's our only chance.

25
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,000
维克托是一切的始作俑者 对不对
Viktor's at the center of all this, isn't he?

26
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,160
我们本来就没有什么胜算
We're meant to lose this fight.

27
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,160
要是他到了海克斯飞门的话
If he reaches the Hexgates...

28
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,660
那就尽全力阻止他
Then we'd best stop him.

29
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,500
快走
Move, move!

30
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,120
派增援保护远程火力
Reinforce the forward artillery. 

31
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,160
- 绝不能让他们攻进来 - 去吧
- We can't let them break through. - Go.

32
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,330
我们走
Let's go.

33
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,080
把大门关上
- Hold it. - Go.

34
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,870
上弹药
Reload.

35
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,080
把她面具拿掉 你怎么样
- Give her some air. - You're okay.

36
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,040
趴下
Down!

37
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,240
快点
Come on.

38
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,290
快走
Let's go.

39
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,160
人不大 胆儿不小啊
Bold, little one.

40
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:51,830
- 带上你的人 随时待命 - 先等等
- Move your units and wait there. - Stay. 

41
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,120
快点
Come on!

42
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,660
我提醒过你公私不分会是什么下场
I warned you of the hazards of professional entanglement.

43
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,000
铤而走险 只会让你万劫不复 孩子
Desperation is the doorway to oblivion, child.

44
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,080
赶紧了结了吧
Let's get this over with.

45
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,330
我会念着你对我的好
I did appreciate your warmth.

46
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,990
如果你心里还在乎我 那就饶他们一命
If you care for me at all, spare their lives.

47
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,450
这样的杀戮根本没有任何意义 而你也什么也得不到
There is nothing to gain from this senseless bloodshed.

48
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,620
还是想当狐狸
Still a fox.

49
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,200
士兵
Soldier.

50
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,540
列队
Get in line.

51
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,040
开火
Fire!

52
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,160
跟我走
Let's run.

53
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,950
维克托在哪儿
Where is Viktor?

54
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,870
即便走到了今天这般田地 杰斯
Despite the circumstances, Jayce...

55
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,410
我依然很高兴与你会面
I am... pleased to see you.

56
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,750
我不相信曾经的那个你已经完全不在
There must be some part of you still in there.

57
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,370
现在的我所向披靡
I am more than I ever was.

58
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,080
母亲
Mother, 

59
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,120
看看你为野心付出的代价
look at the price of your ambition.

60
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:37,370
牺牲一切都在所不惜
You've sacrificed everything.

61
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,830
雷克托斯
Rictus.

62
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,000
基诺
Kino.

63
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,370
我为了家族建起的这座城邦
This city I built for our family.

64
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,500
你要真为了家族 就不会与我为敌
If it was for us, you wouldn't have fought me.

65
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,000
你不配姓米达尔达
You are no Medarda.

66
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,910
还记得你的...
You remember your--

67
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:57,620
少废话 动手吧
Shut up and fight.

68
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,410
蔚
Vi!

69
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,620
蔚
Vi!

70
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,660
蔚
Vi!

71
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,950
这就是你跟我倾尽一生所追求的答案
It is the answer you and I pursued all our lives.

72
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,330
消除所有残暴 所有不公
An end to cruelty, injustice.

73
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:26,910
我们每一个人都参与其中 轮流撰写着这个进化传奇
All of us our own authors to an unbroken saga of progress.

74
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,580
我们每一个人都从中获益
To the benefit of all.

75
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,950
每一个人的命运都应该由自己选择
People deserve to choose their own fates.

76
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,790
选择并不存在
Choice is false.

77
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,700
那只是一种说辞而已
It is how we clothe and forgive

78
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,870
用来掩盖和宽恕 令我们产生分歧的本能
the baser instincts that spur us to division.

79
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:47,450
比如死亡 战争 还有偏见
Death, war, prejudice.

80
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,700
这个过程也只不过是一种能量内耗
Energy spent only to consume itself.

81
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:57,000
然而我们能实现的是
But we can be of one mind.

82
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,580
众心归一
United.

83
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,790
虽败犹荣 孩子
You fought well, child.

84
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,620
动手
Now!

85
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,450
狼本就冷血无情
A wolf has no mercy.

86
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:30,620
你女儿比你想象的更有智慧
Your daughter is wiser than you credit.

87
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,830
我敬佩你 安蓓萨
I salute you, Ambessa.

88
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,790
虽是凡夫俗子
For one without the gift,

89
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:38,200
却令我们感到棘手
you were quite a thorn.

90
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,000
你来干什么 姐妹
What are you doing, sister?

91
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,620
你的真面目我认清了 骗子
I see your face, deceiver.

92
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,000
算你聪明
Sly girl.

93
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,040
你是真正的狼
You are the wolf.

94
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,450
看样子你不应该回来的
Looks like you shouldn't have come back.

95
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,540
你还是不明白啊 姐姐
Still don't get it, huh, sis?

96
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,160
我和你从来没有分开过
I'm always with you.

97
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,950
即便我们天各一方
Even when we're worlds apart.

98
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,950
结束这场闹剧吧 维克托
Stop this insanity, Viktor.

99
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,620
说得没错 我也正有此意
That is precisely my intention.

100
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,200
你的眼睛骗不了人
Your eyes won't lie...

101
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,910
你的心已经被
when your mind...

102
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:33,580
打开了 杰斯
is open, Jayce.

103
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,250
范德尔
Vander.

104
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,580
爸爸
Dad?

105
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:54,540
看到了吗
Do you see?

106
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:00,040
一场秩序与混乱前所未有的极致碰撞
The sublime intersection of order and chaos.

107
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,830
这就是你所看到的吗
This is what you see?

108
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,790
这场纷争
This conflict.

109
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,040
这种毫无意义的消耗
This senseless waste.

110
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,540
我了解他们的内心 杰斯
I know their minds, Jayce.

111
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:06,330
他们渴望更好的生活 而情感与理智却在对抗
They want better lives, but emotion clashes with reason.

112
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:11,540
这其实是人性走向堕落的内在矛盾
Humanity's self-corrupting contradiction.

113
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:15,540
你始终执着于弥补你认为不足的东西
You've always wanted to cure what you thought were weaknesses.

114
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,330
你的腿
Your leg.

115
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,410
还有你的病
Your disease.

116
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,330
但那不是你的缺陷 维克托
But you were never broken, Viktor.

117
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:27,000
不完美本身也有它自己的美
There is beauty in imperfections.

118
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,250
它是你无法割舍的一部分
They made you who you are.

119
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,660
也正是因为有了它 才有了完整的你
An inseparable piece of everything...

120
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,540
这样的你令我钦佩
I admired about you.

121
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,000
那个装置 不可能
That device can't be.

122
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,950
我曾希望你我可以将魔法带给世界
I thought I wanted us to give magic to the world.

123
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,000
但现在 我只希望
Now... all I want...

124
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,620
我的搭档可以回来
is my partner back.

125
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,450
你为什么要如此执着
Why do you persist?

126
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,200
毕竟我做了那么多事
After everything I've done?

127
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:26,620
因为我答应过你
Because I promised you.

128
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,750
为什么你要给我这个
Why did you ever give me this?

129
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,080
为什么
Why?

130
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,660
我曾以为自己能终结这世上的疾苦
I thought I could bring an end to the world's suffering.

131
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,790
而当我解决了所有难题之后
But when every equation was solved...

132
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,580
前方迎接我的
all that remained...

133
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,870
只剩一片无梦的孤寂
were fields of dreamless solitude.

134
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,580
实现完美并无奖赏
There is no prize to perfection.

135
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,450
追求完美却有终点
Only an end to pursuit.

136
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,500
在所有的时间线里
In all timelines,

137
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,540
在这一切的可能中
in all possibilities...

138
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,040
只有你
only you...

139
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,580
能让我看清这点
can show me this.

140
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,750
你该走了 杰斯
You must go, Jayce.

141
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
我们一起结束这一切
We finish this together.

142
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,830
蔚
Vi!

143
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,540
蔚 快跳到那根横梁上去
Vi, hurry, you can make the other ledge.

144
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,950
蔚
Vi!

145
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,250
你这是...
What are you...?

146
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,790
蔚
Vi.

147
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,250
蔚
Vi?

148
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,000
你救不了他的
You can't save him.

149
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,950
蔚
Vi!

150
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:08,040
我一直都在
Always with you, sis.

151
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,700
或许你曾读到过皮尔特沃夫之战
You may read about the war in Piltover.

152
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:31,660
但历史总是被轻描淡写 一笔带过
But history is made palatably abstract.

153
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:33,450
而在现实中
For its truth...

154
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:38,250
每一次牺牲的悲痛哀嚎
the agony of every sacrifice...

155
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,910
每一次胜利的热泪盈眶
the exaltation of every triumph...

156
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,620
都非常人所能承受
is more than one should bear.

157
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:05,160
曾经种种 造就了我们的今天
We... whose decisions led us here,

158
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,750
也将烙印在我们的余生里
will carry them forever.

159
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:17,700
欣慰的是在每一次的失去中
Our only consolation that with every loss,

160
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,000
都能寻回善良
we found some good,

161
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,120
重见光明
some light,

162
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:23,910
这些收获
worth gaining,

163
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,790
值得奋力一搏
worth fighting for.

164
00:44:37,330 --> 00:44:40,830
或许我们还是会重复曾经犯过的错误
And though we are doomed to revisit the error of our ways...

165
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,750
燃起更多的战火
spark ever more conflicts...

166
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,330
我们的故事仍未结束
our story isn't over.

167
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:30,540

(风道与冷却系统)

169
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:03,080
这是在哼什么呢
Is that... singing?

170
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,700
这个调子我妈妈以前经常哼
It's just a tune my mother used to hum.

171
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,080
还会与我并肩作战吗 蔚奥莱
Are you still in this fight, Violet?

172
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,620
我就是你指甲缝里的泥 小蛋糕
I am the dirt under your nails, cupcake.

173
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,250
怎么洗都洗不掉
Nothing's gonna clean me out.
