牛仔竞技赛的条条大路都通向这里
Every road from the rodeo leads right here.

9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,800
今天什么日子
What day is it?

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,380
今天是医院的发薪日
Well, it's payday, for the hospital.

11
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:51,510
他们和你一起中了彩票
They won the lottery with you...

12
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,970
我拿笔记下来了
Had to write all this shit down...

13
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,100
你的颈部有压迫性骨折
You have a compression fracture in your neck

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,600
背后还有两处
and two in your back.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,980
一块骨头碎片压在你的脊椎上
A bone fragment's pressed against your spine,

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,210
还不知道该怎么弄出来
can't figure out how to get that out.

17
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:08,330
你的髋关节粉碎性骨折  他们刚给你换了新的
Shattered your hip, which they just up and replaced.

18
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,750
医生说你是他见过的最年轻的
Doctor said you're the youngest person he's ever done that to.

19
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:13,950
所以恭喜你
So, congratulations for that.

20
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:16,080
他想让你今天起来走走
He wants you up and walking today.

21
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,500
我觉得根本没戏
How that's possible I have... I have no idea...

22
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,330
你有三级脑震荡
You have a grade three concussion.

23
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:27,440
如果你感到恶心或懵圈
We're supposed to bring you back to the hospital

24
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,300
我们就得把你送回医院
if you experience nausea or confusion.

25
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,940
我问了还有没有其他症状
I asked if there's other symptoms

26
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,350
因为恶心和懵圈是你的正常状态
since nauseous and confused is your natural state of being.

27
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,910
他们说你的瞳孔可能会放大
They said your eyes might dilate.

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:40,520
我们会留意的
So, we'll be on the lookout for that.

29
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,560
我胳膊怎么了
What's wrong with my arm?

30
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,910
他们没提你的胳膊
Well, they didn't mention your arm.

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,360
所以肯定没事
So it must be fine.

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,780
感觉好像有事啊
Doesn't look fine.

33
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,200
跟其他的比起来  不算什么了
Well, compared to the rest of this shit, it's fine.

34
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,580
我要怎么
How am I gonna...

35
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,410
我怎么付得起呢
How am I gonna pay for all this?

36
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,630
医院也很好奇
Well, the hospital's pretty curious about that themselves.

37
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,590
看着我
Look at me.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,510
医院账单不用你担心
Hospital bill's not a concern.

39
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,730
但你得向我保证
But you gotta make me a promise.

40
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:27,100
别再参加牛仔竞技了
No more rodeo.

41
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,740
这是唯一一件
It's the only thing that ever...

42
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,780
让我觉得自己有价值的事情
ever made me feel like I was worth something.

43
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,080
嗯
Yeah.

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,080
我猜也是
Well, I figured as much.

45
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,050
学套索吧
Learn to rope.

46
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,680
最惨也只是失去一根拇指
All you're risking is a thumb, and...

47
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,260
反正你有两个
you got two of those.

48
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,150
达顿先生
Mister Dutton, uh...

49
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,730
谢谢
Thank you.

50
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,700
学套索吧  吉米
Yeah, well, learn to rope, Jimmy.

51
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,660
我可不会帮你付两次医疗费
I'm not paying for this shit twice.

52
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,540
吉米
Okay, Jimmy.

53
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,250
我们扶你起来  让你走走
We're going to help you up so you can walk.

54
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,130
我不太想走路  所以
Don't really feel like walking, so...

55
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,880
你的髋关节换过了  所以你得活动一下
Your hip replacement needs you to move around a bit.

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,930
但我们得先移除你的导尿管
But first we need to remove your catheter.

57
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:47,020
好  抬起来
All right, just lift.

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,100
好了
There we go.

59
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:50,560
好  深呼吸
All right, deep breath.

60
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,230
拉的时候你会感觉到一点压力
You're going to feel a little pressure when I pull, okay?

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,940
你活下来了
You survived.

62
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,990
好吧  最大的谜题先被我解开了
All right, getting the mystery out of the way right up front, huh?

63
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,390
它是肿了吗
Is it just... is it swollen from the...

64
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,250
本来就是这样
I think it's the way God made that one.

65
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,000
真是醉了
This isn't happening.

66
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,630
我可以帮忙吗
Can I help?

67
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,300
你是亲属吗
Are you a relative?

68
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,970
是的  我  我是他女朋友
Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm his girlfriend.

69
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,600
没问题  过来  抓住一只胳膊
Yeah, sure. Just, uh, come over here. Grab an arm.

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,150
来
All right, here.

71
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,800
我不知道我适不适合
I don't know if I can be in a relationship

72
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,160
和一个如此缺乏判断力的人恋爱
with someone who shows such poor judgment.

73
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,590
我是绕桶赛手
Well, I'm a barrel racer.

74
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,330
肯定缺乏判断力啊
So bad judgment's just part of the package.

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,250
你没养狗吧
Don't have a dog, do you?

76
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,210
其实我养了两条
I have two, actually.

77
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,040
怪不得
That fuckin' figures.

78
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,750
{\an8}黄石
第三季  第四集

79
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,500
{\an8}漆马赌场酒店

80
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,300
这样不合适吧  主席
I am not sure this is appropriate, Chairman.

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,710
我不是詹金斯财产的律师
I don't represent the Jenkins' estate.

82
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,450
我是说剩下的财产
Or, whatever's left of it, I mean.

83
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,370
我现在不关心他的财产
His estate is not my concern at the moment.

84
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,330
这个合法吗
Is there any validity to this?

85
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,300
{\an8}停止命

86
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,920
他们在下象棋
It's a chess move.

87
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,280
这样会让你处于防守状态  阻止你建房
It puts you on the defensive. Stops you from building.

88
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,860
但他们赢不了啊
But... But they don't have a winnable case.

89
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,660
赢的定义是什么
Well, define winnable.

90
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,080
如果你是指对他们有利的判决  那是没有
If you mean a judgment in their favor? No.

91
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,150
但是他们可以拖上好几年
But, you know, they can drag this out for years.

92
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,920
这不是一个举债经营的土地开发商
This isn't a leveraged land developer,

93
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,330
这是一个价值数十亿美元的公司
this is a multibillion dollar corporation

94
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,000
他们可以花五千万到一亿美元的律师费
that can spend 50, 100 million dollars in legal fees.

95
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,300
而且现实是
And the reality is, that,

96
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,840
我觉得他们根本不想要你的土地
you know, I doubt they even want your land.

97
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,550
他们只是不想让印第安赌场
They just don't want an Indian casino

98
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,160
位于他们规划的社区附近
adjacent to a planned community.

99
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,340
所以他们想买下我的产权
So, they'll try to buy me out.

100
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,590
我觉得他们不会费那个劲
I doubt they'll even bother.

101
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,550
我能问你个问题吗  私人问题
May I ask you a question? A personal question?

102
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,530
你当初为什么要建赌场
Why build a casino in the first place?

103
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,030
真正的原因是什么
I mean what's the real reason?

104
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,930
交通更加便捷的好地方还有很多
There are better locations with far better access.

105
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,310
这个山谷有两个未来
There's two futures with this valley,

106
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,580
一个是土地被二套房和爱好农场剥夺
one with the land stripped of the second homes

107
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,570
然后回到从前的样子
and hobby farms, and returned to the ways it used to be...

108
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,370
你开了20英里到公园
You drive twenty miles into the park

109
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,410
整个国家曾经都觉得很正常
and that's how our whole nation looked at one time.

110
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:36,180
现代社会希望人们去上学
Modern society wants people to go to school

111
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,750
学着做生意赚钱
and learn a trade to make money

112
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,340
买吃的  穿的  居住的地方
to buy food, clothes, a place to live.

113
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:45,090
但在没有被人类蹂躏过的土地上
But on land that hasn't been ravaged by man,

114
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,300
不需要买吃的
you don't need to buy food.

115
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,640
而是寻找吃的
You just go find it.

116
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,760
不用买衣服  而是制作衣服
You don't buy clothes, you make them.

117
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,770
不用盖房子  而是寻找遮盖物
And you don't build houses, you seek shelter.

118
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,520
和土地一起生活  而非在土地上生活
You live with the land. Not on it.

119
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,230
你说有两个未来  另一个是什么
You said two futures. What's the other?

120
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,980
另一个是你居住的地方
The other's where you live.

121
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,590
混凝土世界里的木屋
Concrete worlds with stick houses

122
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:11,910
没有肥料和洒水器就无法生存的草
and grass that can't survive without fertilizer and sprinklers.

123
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,680
总有一天  这个星球会把你们
Some day this planet's going to shake your world

124
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,540
像雨水一样甩掉
off its back like rainwater.

125
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,170
赌场给了我足够的钱来确保这件事一定会发生
The casino gives me the money I need to make sure that happens.

126
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,750
第一个未来是唯一的未来
The first future is the only future.

127
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,420
恐怕人们更喜欢混凝土
People prefer concrete, I'm afraid.

128
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,470
没人喜欢你的未来
Nobody wants your future.

129
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,010
你的世界根本就没有人
No one in your world.

130
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,390
好吧
Well...

131
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,770
我很想告诉你该怎么对抗他们
I wish I could tell you how to fight them.

132
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,250
如果有人知道如何对抗他们
If anyone knew how to fight them,

133
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,310
就不会有什么保留地了
there'd be no such thing as reservations.

134
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,490
你怎么看  老莫
What do you think, Mo?

135
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,080
我觉得你需要的是律师  不是他
I think you need a lawyer and not him.

136
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,500
像他这样的人自有用处
Well, men like him have their use.

137
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:07,050
但是这件事他帮不上忙
But no, not for this...

138
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,360
我们一直都知道如何对抗他们  汤姆
We've always known how to fight them, Tom.

139
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,340
我们没有行动  只是因为我们不想变得像他们一样
We just didn't 'cause we didn't want to be like them.

140
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,890
我觉得你该变得像他们一样了
I think it's time you be like them.

141
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,100
人民永远不会原谅我的
The people would never forgive me.

142
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:25,020
-这是为了人民  -他们还是不会原谅我
- It's for the people.  -Still won't forgive me.

143
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,780
但我还是得行动
But I'm going to do it anyway.

144
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,160
帮我接通约翰·达顿的电话
Get John Dutton on the phone for me.

145
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,830
安吉拉·布鲁·桑德  谢谢
Angela Blue Thunder, please.

146
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,380
雷恩沃特主席
Chairman Rainwater.

147
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,590
你跟她谈过以后必须要烧鼠尾草
You're going to need to sage off after you speak with her.

148
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:50,920
我知道
I know.

149
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,850
{\an8}舒瓦茨和梅耶

150
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,570
你戳了一只大熊啊  贝丝
That's a pretty big bear to poke, Beth.

151
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,470
他们在山谷的活动让我们的股份增长了20%
And their activity in the valley has our holdings up twenty percent.

152
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:02,980
我没有戳他们  这是个机会  鲍勃
I'm not poking them, It's an opportunity, Bob.

153
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,450
如果他们认为机场审批没问题
If they thought their airport approvals were guaranteed,

154
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,290
他们肯定会在屋顶上尖叫的
they would be screaming it from the rooftops.

155
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,500
现在还不到卖空的时候吧
Tell me it is not ripe to short.

156
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,160
你放话出去  他们就会知道是你了
When you put the word out, they're going to know it's you.

157
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,160
我不会放话出去的
Well, I'm not gonna put the word out.

158
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,530
你来
You are.

159
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,430
可以卖空了  你不同意吗
It is ripe to short. Do you disagree?

160
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,250
他们暴露了  没错
They're exposed, it's true.

161
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,930
这会让他们伤得很深
And it's gonna cut them pretty deep,

162
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,350
然后他们会全力反击的
and they are going to come out swinging.

163
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:31,380
这就是塞伦盖蒂的生活吧
Yeah, well, that's just life in the Serengeti, I guess.

164
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,780
你想打给基金经理还是媒体
You want to call the fund managers or the press?

165
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,990
我打给经理
I'll take the managers.

166
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,410
但是只能稍微漏点水  贝丝
But, Beth, just a little leak.

167
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:42,910
稍微漏点水  不要炸掉水坝
Just a leak, you know? Do not blow up the dam.

168
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,290
拜托  鲍勃  你还不了解我嘛
Oh, come on, Bob. You know me better than that.

169
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,230
所以我才这么说的
That's why I'm saying just a leak.

170
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:49,360
中等程度的漏水
A medium leak.

171
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,030
既然做了  就要做的漂亮
Anything worth doing is worth doing right.

172
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:53,280
对吗
Right?

173
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,700
谢谢  回见
Thank you. I'll call you back.

174
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,370
-股票交易员  -亚当·提利还在主持新闻发布会吗
- Stock trader. - Hi, is Adam Tilly still running press releases?

175
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,520
-是的  -帮我接通一下
- Yep. - Put me through to him.

176
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,420
稍等
One moment.

177
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,560
那面旗是干什么的
What's that flag for?

178
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:15,080
用来教这些小马驹如何正确操控自己的身体
Well, it teaches these colts to use their bodies

179
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,360
然后再用真正的牛
the right way before I put them on a cow.

180
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,820
为什么不直接用牛呢
Why not just use a cow?

181
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:24,260
我靠  女士  那不就相当于在拳赛中
For hell's sakes, lady, that's kind of like practicing a fist fight

182
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,140
以赛代练了么
when you're already in the middle of one,

183
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,750
明白我的意思吗
ya know what I mean?

184
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:29,250
这是个艰难的决定
A tough call.

185
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,380
操  你是州长
Oh fuck, you're the Governor.

186
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,920
女士  对不起  操  我
Miss, I'm sorry. Fuck, I...

187
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,470
-我很抱歉  -闭嘴  杰克
- I'm sorry. - Shut up, Jake.

188
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,590
我找约翰
I'm looking for John.

189
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,760
他在山上的夏季营地
He's up there at the summer camp.

190
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:47,220
你能指条路吗
Well, can you point the way?

191
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,200
那边
It's that way but

192
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,350
但你们开车上不去啊
you ain't gonna get them machines up there.

193
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,360
你会骑马吗
Can you, uh, can you ride a horse?

194
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,400
我会
Yeah, I can ride.

195
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,990
太好了  我去给你备一匹马
Perfect, I'll go saddle you one.

196
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,820
女士  我们不能让你骑马
Ma'am, we can't have you on a horse.

197
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,200
-出于安全考虑  -他
- Safety concerns. - He's, uh...

198
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,330
他说不能骑马  所以
He's saying no to the horse, so...

199
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,040
他担心我摔下去蒙大拿就完了
He's worried Montana won't survive if I fall off.

200
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,000
那好吧
Well, hell, uh...

201
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,920
我有个更好的主意
I got a better idea.

202
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,620
-谢谢  -不客气
- Thank you. - Yes, Ma'am.

203
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,770
原来你一直躲在这里啊
So, this is where you've been hiding out, huh?

204
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,720
这地方不错吧
Yeah, well, pretty good spot, huh?

205
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,030
是啊  我明白你为什么这么努力维护这里了
Yeah, I can see why you fight so hard for it.

206
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,260
是啊  没人
Yeah. No one, uh...

207
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,180
这里没有人会质疑
No one questions it from here.

208
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,600
什么风把你吹来了
To what do I owe the pleasure?

209
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,690
什么风  约翰
The pleasure, John?

210
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,650
我觉得你在树林里待太久了
I think you've been in the woods too long.

211
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,900
凯斯呢
Where's Kayce?

212
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,450
嗯
Yeah.

213
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,290
杰克
Jake...

214
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,630
你回屋子去找杰米
I need you to run back to the house and grab Jamie.

215
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,440
那得花点时间
That's... That's gonna take me a little while.

216
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,100
嗯  别提前回来
Yeah. Make sure of it.

217
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,520
遵命
Yes, sir.

218
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,080
约翰说他任命你当牲畜委员会委员
John says you refused his appointment

219
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,560
可你拒绝了
to Livestock Commissioner.

220
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,480
我不是政客
Yeah, I'm not a politician.

221
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:04,280
那不是政客的工作
That's not a job for a politician.

222
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,030
你父亲确实是出于这个目的  但是
I mean, sure, your father used it that way, but...

223
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,990
那是因为他有能力
That's because he could.

224
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,140
蒙大拿的牧民需要的
What the cattlemen of Montana need

225
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,250
是保护他们生计的人
is someone to protect their livelihood.

226
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,670
这就是工作的本质
That's the job.

227
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,380
你可以做得很好
And at that, you would excel.

228
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,590
现在那是杰米的工作了
Well, that's Jamie's job now.

229
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,800
不  我需要杰米做别的事
No, I need Jamie for something else.

230
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,550
你父亲也一样
So does your father.

231
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:30,760
要他干什么
Need him for what?

232
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,680
帮我阻止这个山谷变成城市
To help me prevent this valley from becoming a city.

233
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,600
变成城市又如何
What do you care if it becomes a city?

234
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,230
变成城市对你更有利吧
Feel like a city would be good for you.

235
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,130
这就是我的立场最大的冲突
That's the great conflict of my position, you know?

236
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,030
如何让蒙大拿继续发展
How to keep Montana growing

237
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,660
但是不失去蒙大拿的特色
without losing that thing that makes it Montana.

238
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,330
那就拒绝呗
Well, then just say no.

239
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,000
就不会有城市了
There'll be no city.

240
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,120
如果我拒绝了  他们就会去找同意的人
If I say no, they just go and get someone that says yes,

241
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,000
到时候我的工作就被那个人抢了
and that person has my job.

242
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,210
我不懂
Don't make sense.

243
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,760
嗯  是挺难懂的
No, it doesn't make sense to you.

244
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,890
但是杰米懂了
But it makes sense to Jamie.

245
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,560
他知道怎么利用法律来拒绝
He knows how to make the law say no.

246
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:18,310
我要任命他为检察长
I'm appointing him Attorney General,

247
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,560
然后任命你为牲畜委员会委员
and I'm appointing you Livestock Commissioner,

248
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,030
你要抛开害怕变成你父亲那样的恐惧
and you will set aside your fears of becoming like your father

249
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,750
承担起这个责任
and take on this responsibility

250
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:33,780
因为如果你不愿意  这一切都会消失
because all of this disappears if you don't.

251
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,830
命运很难逃避  不是吗
Destiny's a hard thing to run from, isn't it?

252
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,090
但是比我想象中快多了
Just turned out to be a lot faster than I thought.

253
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,130
那就这么定了
Well, that's settled then.

254
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,470
如果我答应你
If I do this,

255
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,930
我得按我的方式来
I gotta do it my way.

256
00:16:58,280 --> 00:16:59,680
这是你的办公室
It's your office.

257
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,480
随你啊
You can do it however you want.

258
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,540
亲爱的
Hello, dear.

259
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,040
今天过的怎么样
How was your day?

260
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:25,890
当你爸爸厌倦了睡在外面
When your dad gets tired of sleeping outside,

261
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:28,090
他就想知道他女儿睡在哪里了
he's gonna wonder where his daughter's sleeping.

262
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,610
幸运的是
Yeah, well, lucky for us,

263
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,480
他最喜欢在外面睡觉了
sleeping outside is his favorite thing to do.

264
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,320
我们得小心点  不然我会养成习惯的  亲爱的
We gotta be careful or I'm gonna get used to shit, darling.

265
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:37,850
我就是这么计划的
Well, that's the plan.

266
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,310
你还有计划了
Oh, you got plans, do you?

267
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,560
我对一切都有计划
I have a plan for everything.

268
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,940
一个人坐在自己的网里
Just sitting in your web, all alone,

269
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:49,780
制定计划
Coming up with plans.

270
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,590
-你还挺幽默  -可不嘛
- And a sense of humor? - Yeah, you know.

271
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:57,430
天啊  之前怎么没发现呢
God, where did that come from?

272
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:59,700
开玩笑  我一直都很幽默
What are you talking about? I've been funny all my life.

273
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,470
你有很多特质  但并不包括幽默  宝贝
You are many things, but baby, funny is not one of them.

274
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,460
抱歉
Sorry.

275
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,380
再叫我一声
Call me that again.

276
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,970
叫你什么
Call you what?

277
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,600
宝贝  再叫一声
Baby. Say that again.

278
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,560
你喜欢吗
You like that, do you?

279
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,060
是的
Yeah, I do.

280
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,610
好的  宝贝
Okay, baby.

281
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:37,410
我该怎么叫你
What should I call you?

282
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,580
妻子
Wife.

283
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,510
我不是那个意思
I didn't mean that.

284
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,010
我给你做一顿晚餐吧
I'm gonna make you dinner for once.

285
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,410
我的车呢
Where's my ride?

286
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,740
他会回来的
He'll be back.

287
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,160
什么时候
When?

288
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:27,920
那就
Well, that's...

289
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,920
那就
...that's...

290
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:31,710
很难说了  喝一杯吗
...that's hard to say. Want a drink?

291
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,080
这和绑架差不多了
This is... This is almost kidnapping.

292
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,830
放松  莉奈儿  好好享受日落吧
Oh, just relax, Lynelle. Enjoy the sunset.

293
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,620
好吧  只要你别用那种表情看我
Fine, as long as you don't give me that look.

294
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,480
什么表情
What look?

295
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,410
这个表情
That look.

296
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,630
"脱掉裙子  进我帐篷"的表情
That "drop your dress and get in my outfitter tent" look.

297
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,880
我哪有
I'm not giving you any look.

298
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,750
因为我不会留下的  所以你还是少来吧
Yeah, because I'm not staying, so you can just stop it.

299
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:08,870
别闹
Stop it.

300
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,330
我没闹啊
I'm not doing anything.

301
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,690
靠  约翰
Goddammit, John.

302
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,320
为什么不论何时何地
How is it that you're always three steps ahead

303
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,920
你都领先所有人三步呢
of everybody everywhere you go?

304
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,180
我只是经常坐下来思考
It's just a lot of sitting and thinking...

305
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,390
坐下来思考
thinking and sitting.

306
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,440
你又来了
And you're doing it again.

307
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,440
哪有
I'm not doing anything.

308
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,490
我明天一早就得走
I have to leave first thing in the morning.

309
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,870
你想在这过夜吗
You wanna spend the night?

310
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:46,410
你真混
You're such a bastard.

311
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,040
明天一早啊
First thing in the morning, I meant.

312
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,210
二早怎么样
How about second?

313
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,100
你上次看日落是什么时候  州长
When's the last time you watched a sunset, Governor?

314
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,680
我也不知道
I don't know.

315
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,350
我明白他们为什么想卖掉这个梦想了
I can see why this is the dream they want to sell.

316
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,570
是的  但你不能卖  你得自己争取
Yep... but you can't sell this. You gotta earn it.

317
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,860
你得体会  这是他们永远无法理解的
You gotta live it. And that's what they'll never understand.

318
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,700
但他们只想卖
But they only want to sell it.

319
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,120
他们不在乎梦想是否成真
And they could care less about the dream coming true.

320
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,830
这就是你要理解的
That's what you've got to understand.

321
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,260
你还在
You still here?

322
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,720
有难同当嘛
Through thick and thin.

323
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,430
风雨同舟嘛
How you feel?

324
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,850
屁股疼
Hip hurts.

325
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,240
肋骨疼  背疼
Ribs hurt. Back hurts.

326
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,390
你的鸡鸡怎么样了
How's your pecker?

327
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,520
鸡鸡
Pecker.

328
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,320
应该还行
Seems fine.

329
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,740
很好
Good.

330
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,740
我在想我们应该完成这笔买卖
I was thinking we should consummate this deal.

331
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,790
听起来不错  但是
That sounds great, but...

332
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,710
我不知道他们有没有告诉你  我的背断了
I don't know if they told you, my back is broken.

333
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,130
你是说不行吗
Are you saying no?

334
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,860
不  不  不是
No. No. No, no, no.

335
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,010
我只是
I just, um...

336
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:28,470
我不想瘫痪
I don't want it to paralyze me.

337
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,060
可能会让你瘫痪一两分钟
Well, it might paralyze you for a minute or two.

338
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,820
你不是处男吧
You're not a virgin, are you?

339
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,150
什么
What?

340
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,750
拜托  别这样
Come on, no. Come on.

341
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,590
你确定吗
Are you sure?

342
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:47,450
因为你刚才的表情很像害怕的处男
'Cause you got like a scared virgin face.

343
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,470
不  我不是处男  你是处女吗
No, I'm not a virgin. Are you a virgin?

344
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,040
我是绕桶赛手
I'm a barrel racer.

345
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,200
失去处女身就像是
Losing your virginity is like,

346
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,290
参赛的必要条件
it's like a requirement to compete.

347
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,420
我们还是慢慢来吧
Maybe we should, uh, just slow down on this whole deal.

348
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:05,630
你就是处男
You are!

349
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,220
我不是处男
I am not a virgin.

350
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,530
是因为我吗  你不喜欢我吗
Is it me? Are you not attracted to me?

351
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,410
你不喜欢也没关系  但你得告诉我
Cause it's okay if you're not, but you've got to tell me.

352
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,060
不
No, it's...

353
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,400
我是说  你
I mean, you're...

354
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:21,070
你太漂亮了
You're too pretty.

355
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:25,570
我这样的人配不上你
You're too pretty for a guy like me.

356
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,160
她叫什么名字
What's her name?

357
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,080
-谁  -你的初夜  她叫什么名字
- Who? - Your first. What was her name?

358
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:42,170
我没有  我不记得了
I didn't... I can't even remember.

359
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,090
严格来说我还没做过爱  好吗
Okay, no, I haven't technically had sex, all right?

360
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:49,720
你开心了吗
Are you happy?

361
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:53,660
我觉得我的大脚趾里还残留着一点男子气概
I think there's still a shred of manhood left in my big toe

362
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,490
你出去的时候也可以践踏一下
if you want to step on that on the way out.

363
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:57,480
你干什么  你在干什么
What are you... what are you doing?

364
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,310
我要破你的处
I'm being your first.

365
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,260
别紧张
Don't be nervous.

366
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,340
很爽的
It's supposed to be fun.

367
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:37,160
我害怕当你的视力恢复时
I'm scared that when your eyesight returns

368
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,440
只要看我一眼
you're gonna take one look at me--

369
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,440
我的视力没问题
I see just fine.

370
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,860
你才是瞎子呢  吉米
You're the one who's blind, Jimmy.

371
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:48,240
但我也会帮你治好的
But I'm going to fix that too...

372
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,970
早啊
Morning.

373
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,520
的确很早
Yeah, sure is.

374
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,520
宝贝  回来躺下
Baby? Come back to bed.

375
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,450
我
I'll be, uh...

376
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,740
早餐几点
What time's breakfast?

377
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,120
约翰

378
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,000
应该是过一会吧
A little later this morning.

379
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,460
明白
Understood.

380
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,630
回头见
I'll see you in...

381
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,590
嗯  好的
Yeah. You know.

382
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,440

不了  我
Nah, I got a...

我得去参加比尤特的小母牛拍卖会

385
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,030
我搞砸了  不是吗
I fucked it up, didn't I?

386
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:12,550
我把一切都搞砸了  我不是故意的
I fucked the whole thing... I didn't mean it.

387
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,830
听着
Hey, listen.

388
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:18,250
我之所以不跟你聊明天的事  贝丝
The only reason why I don't bring up tomorrow with you, Beth,

389
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,590
是因为每次我一聊
is because every fucking time I do,

390
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,050
你就逃走了
you run away.

391
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:43,320
我把和你在一起的每一天都当做礼物
I look at every day with you as a gift.

392
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,820
我的明天
My tomorrows are...

00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,450
都属于你
Well, they're all yours.

394
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,490
来
Here.

395
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,210
我不知道还能叫你什么
There is no word that I'd rather call you.

396
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,540
如果你希望我这么叫你  那我没问题
I mean, if that's what you want.

397
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,840
你知道我为什么总是逃跑吗
You know why I always run away?

398
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,970
我只能给你这么多  里普
There's only so much I can give to you, Rip.

399

不
No.

00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,580
你可以给我一切
You can give me everything.

不
No.

402
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,490
我不能生孩子
I can't have children.

403
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,120
你要知道这一点
You need to know that.

404
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,210
和我在一起是一条死路
Being with me is the end of you.

405
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,810
我一出生就在一条死路上  亲爱的
I was born on a dead end road, honey.

406
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,890
这个世界不需要我的后代
This world doesn't need another generation of me.

407
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,110
那可不一定
I wouldn't be so sure.

408
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,080
我不喜欢让一群孩子
I don't want a bunch of kids

409
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,540
在这个房子里跑来跑去
running around this fucking house.

我连狗都不喜欢
I mean, I don't even like dogs.

411
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,460
我只需要你
You're all I need.

412
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,170
你想让我叫你什么都可以
I'll call you whatever you want.

413
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,030
暂时叫贝丝吧
Beth is fine. For now.

414
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,320
那就叫你贝丝  亲爱的
Beth it is, darling. Beth it is.

415
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,200
你得去上班了
You gotta go to work.

416
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,330
好的
Okay.

417
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,920
不得不说
I gotta say,

418
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,800
我喜欢看你这样坐在门廊上
I like leaving you sitting here on the porch like this.

419
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,470
要是我回来的时候你还在
Be a whole lot better though,

420
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,720
那就更好了
if you were here when I got home.

421
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,510
那到时候看看吧
Well, I'll see what I can do about that.

422
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:30,080
股票持续下跌
And stocks continue their downward trend

423
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:34,490
又有两家石油公司被列入美国贸易黑名单

见我烧什么都没用  汤姆
There is no protection from me, Tom.

433
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,920
你知道的
You know that.

434
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,980
这才不到一年
It's barely been a year

435
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,820
你就在烧鼠尾草祈祷改变
and already you're burning sage praying for a change,

436
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,300
你自己怎么不改变呢
instead of being it.

437
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,520
我想让这里变得更美好
I'm trying to make it a better place.

438

442
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,440
而且你对此无能为力
And there's nothing you can do about it.

443
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,070
所以我才找你过来
You're what I'm doing about it.

444
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,880
你知道人们是怎么说和魔鬼做交易的吗
You know what they say about making deals with the devil.

445

我不知道  安吉拉  人们怎么说

这是最大的谜团  汤姆
That's the big mystery, Tom.

447
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,590

你会帮忙吗
You'll help?

449

她只是很生气  她想惩罚这个世界
She's just angry and trying to punish the world

452
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,230
对她所做的一切
for everything it did to her.

453
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,650
我知道
Yeah, I know.

454
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,230
这就是邪恶的意思
That's what evil means.

没让你们出来
Nobody said get out.

627
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,230
不用多此一举了
Yeah, not much point in that.

628
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,340
我还有孩子

630
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,370
我觉得你的孩子没有你这个爸爸会更好
And from what I've seen, yours will be better off without you.

631

就在我的地盘中央
Right here in the middle of my field.

636
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,660
如果你们再回来

I'm gonna fill em. You understand?
