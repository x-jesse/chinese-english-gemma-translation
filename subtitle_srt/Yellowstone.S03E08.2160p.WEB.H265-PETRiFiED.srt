我也不知道
I don't either.

141
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,570
感激吧
Gratitude, I guess.

142
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,740

在你死之前  最好一直这么叫我

因为他们害怕会让你失望

311
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,180
靠

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:36,960
他们发现了遗骸

313
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,150
人们总说要做出改变
People talk about making a difference.

314
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,860
但他们没有
But they don't.

315
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:04,070
因为他们从不尝试
Because they don't try.

316
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,570
他们不愿意冒险
They don't risk.

317
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,700
你赌上了一切
You risked. Everything.

318
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,210
今天你做出了改变
And today you made a difference.

319
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,630
因为有传言

有得必有失

我是鲍勃·施瓦茨的助理

杰米给了你什么
What did Jamie give you?

334
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,360
你不是说找个人陪你吗
Thought you said you wanted some company.

335
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,070
为什么

我们开了六个小时的车

罗伊德  我在思考措辞
Lloyd, I'm trying to choose my words.

339
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,670
操  这么久都能写首歌了
Shit, shoulda been able to write the fucking song by now.

你个老好人
You old softy.

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,870
自从离开农场
Been kicking the shit out of this Bloomer

343
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,960
它就被折腾得不轻
ever since we left the ranch.

344
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,030
也该让它最后享受一下时髦的房车之旅  罗伊德
He deserves to have his last trailer ride in style, Lloyd.

345
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,620
放松

00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:56,370
你好像不喜欢和我们住在一起  是吗
Didn't seem to like living with us, did you?

347
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,100
不得不说  我也这么觉得
I gotta say, the feeling is mutual.

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,750
希望你喜欢这里

凯斯是她弟

355
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,900
马上就是你的小舅子了

我不想再经历一次了
I don't want to go through this again.

362
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:45,230
有人会护送你回农场
You'll have an escort to the ranch.

363
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,900
我不需要护送回牧场  只要
Don't need one an escort to the ranch, just, um...

364
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,860
要我打给凯斯吗
Would you like me to call Kayce?

365
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,370
我没告诉他
Didn't tell him I was doing this.

366
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,290
今天闹出这种事  我不知道还怎么告诉他
And based on how today worked out, I'm not sure how.

367
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,130
他是怎么跟你说的
How did he tell you?

368
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,920
跟我说什么
Tell me what?

369
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,110
不是一家人  不进一家门
It's no wonder we're married, huh?

370
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,690
我们的想法一模一样
We think exactly alike.

371
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,810
你有没有想过为什么山里有晰易
You ever wonder why there's leezards in the mountains

372
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,420
么有赊

374
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,890
但我很好奇你他妈在说啥
But I do wonder what the fuck you just said.

375
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,600
但我一直很好奇  所以
But I always wonder that, so...

376
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:19,300

378
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,640
你想裸泳吗
You wanna go skinny dipping?

379
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,830
裸泳
Skinny dipping?

380
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:28,060
你现在知道我在说什么了吧
You ain't wondering what I said now, are ya?

381
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:30,520
不  我们还要修围栏呢
No, we got a whole fence to fix.

382
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,420
围栏又不会跑
Fence ain't goin nowhere.

383
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,260
宝贝  脱光吧
Come on, baby. Let's get naked.

384
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,170
这是个测试
This is a test.

385
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:42,510
这只是个测试  好吧
Yeah, just a test. Yeah, okay.

386
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,440
管它呢
Fuck it.

387
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,010
看什么看  混蛋
Hell you looking at, fuckheads?

388
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,870
这里不是让你们免费看奶子的
This ain't no free titty show.

389
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,330
这个人的嘴也挺能说啊
What about the mouth on this one?

390
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,100
你帮她擦擦耳朵后面  说不定还能值点钱
You scrub her behind her ears she might be worth a twirl.

391
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,870
你们走错边了
You're on the wrong side of the fence.

392
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,480
今天对你来说
Looks like the whole world is on the wrong side

393
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,880
全世界都走错边了
of the fence for you today.

394
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,670
你们走吧
You need to move on now.

395
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,740
你们赶紧滚出我们的农场
Why don't you just go ahead and get the fuck off our ranch?

396
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,530
这是你的农场了吗
Oh, it's your ranch now. Is it?

397
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:26,740
你帮我给约翰·达顿带个口信
I want you to give John Dutton a message for me.

398
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,140
是吗  什么口信
Oh, yeah? What's that?

399
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,660
请把门关上
Close the door, please.

400
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:40,340
今天不顺吗
Rough day?

401
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:42,720
你今天过的怎么样
How was your day?

402
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,260
我每天过的都一样  宝贝
Mine are all the same, baby.

403
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,930
是吗  都一样吗
Are they? All the same?

404
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,560
你骗我的时候脑子里在想什么
What goes through your mind when you're lying to me?

405
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,290
保护我吗  保护什么呢
You're protecting me? From what?

406
00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:00,030
你都干了那么多缺德事
After all I've seen you do.

407
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,490
但我不能生气  因为这就是我骗你的原因
But I can't be angry because that's why I lie to you.

408
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:10,200
-你撒了什么谎  -你撒了什么谎
- What did you lie about? - What did you lie about?

409
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,140
我不想告诉你是因为
I didn't want to tell you because

410
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,090
我每次的原因都一样
it's always the same story with me.

411
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,970
我总是处于需要杀人或被杀的境地
I'm always in a position where I need to kill or be killed.

412
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,060
现在还变成了我的工作
Hell, it's my job now.

413
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,270
我不想说  是因为
I don't want to say anything because...

414
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,150
我不想让你觉得我是个坏人
I don't want you to think I'm a bad man.

415
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,860
哪怕我会这么想
Even if I think it.

416
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,750
我不想让你这么想  因为如果你这么想
I don't want you to think it because if you think it,

417
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,820
那就是真的了
then it's true.

418
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,450
自从我认识你  这就是你的工作  凯斯
It's been your job since I've met you, Kayce.

419
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:56,850
我相信你杀人
And I believe in my heart that every man you killed

420
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:58,920
是为了让世界变得更安全
has made the world a safer place.

421
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,800
这就是我对自己杀人的感觉
That's how I feel about the man I killed.

422
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,270
我今天杀了一个人
I-I killed a man today.

423
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:01,560
这可不像是娇羞的新酿啊
That's not the glow of a blushing bride.

424
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,400
爸
Oh, Dad...

425
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,580
我几年前就被操的不会娇羞了
the blush was fucked out of me years ago.

426
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,570
靠
Jesus.

427
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,960
宝贝  我喜欢咱俩爷们的对话  但是
Baby, I love our man-to-man talks, but...

428
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:14,530
我们得建立一些界限
We need to set some goddamn boundaries here.

429
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,800
我没办法假装没听到  亲爱的
I can't unhear that, honey.

430
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,420
这是个比喻
It was a metaphor, sort of...

431
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,260
我给你看样东西
Look, I gotta show you something.

432
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:33,800
但在此之前  我想让你知道
But before I do, I want you to know this about me--

433
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,640
我知道你已经知道了  但我得再说一遍
I know you already know it, but I got to say it again.

434
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,940
我做的一切都是为了你
Everything I do is for you.

435
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,030
让你满意
To please you.

436
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,570
保护你
To protect you.

437
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:55,300
我可以用数据  事实  理性地告诉你
And I can tell you what I think is best,

438
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,040
我觉得什么是最好的
with data and facts and zero emotion,

439
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,750
但我会照你说的做
but I will do whatever it is you tell me to do.

440
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:04,790
好
Okay.

441
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:25,040
你相信这个提议是合法的吗
And you believe this offer is legitimate?

442
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,110
他们明天会电汇10%的定金
They will wire ten percent earnest money tomorrow

443
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,650
七天时间收尾
with a seven day close.

444
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,530
现在你可以告诉我  我为什么应该这么做
Now you're going to tell me all the reasons I should do it.

445
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,740
我不相信"应该"
I don't believe in should.

446
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,910
我只能告诉你不这么做的后果
All I'll tell you is the consequences of not doing it.

447
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,710
我只求你可以听我说
And all I ask is that you listen.

448
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,710
我会听的  亲爱的
I'll listen, honey.

449
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,850
如果你不接受
If you don't accept,

450
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:52,670
他们会向政府施压  征收这片土地
they will press the state to condemn the land.

451
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,860
他们会提出动议  让杰米无法为州政府辩护
They will file a motion to recuse Jamie from representing the State

452
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,560
因为他在农场享有经济利益
because of his financial interests in the ranch.

453
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,200
他们会找第三方律师
They will bring in outside counsel and Jamie,

454
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,230
而杰米  虽然我非常恨他
and how much I hate him,

455
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,400
但他是本州的诉讼律师
he is the litigator for the state,

456
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:10,280
他将无法为我们辩护
and he will no longer be available to us,

457
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,190
除非他辞职
unless he resigns.

458
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:16,670
就连我都能看出在这个特殊时期
And even I can see the value in having him in office

459
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,320
他任职的作用有多大
at this particular moment.

460
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,240
他们会征收这片土地
They will condemn this land

461
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:25,720
然后付给你15%的佣金
and they will pay you fifteen cents on the dollar.

462
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,750
如果这样
If that.

463
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,600
农场的剩余土地也会以类似的方式
And what remains of the ranch will be taken from you

464
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,130
从你手上被夺走
in a similar fashion,

465
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,480
这并不重要
which doesn't really fucking matter

466
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,150
因为房产税很可能
because the property taxes will most likely

467
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,780
会在接下来的三四年内侵蚀你的存款
erode your savings within the next three to four years.

468
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,410
我可以再撑个两年
Now I can cover them for a couple more,

469
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:44,780
但到头来  你只是在变卖土地
but in the end you're just selling off land

470
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,270
一边交税一边没有任何产出
to pay the taxes while making nothing.

471
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,540
这个循环会一直持续到农场
So the cycle will continue until the ranch

472
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,690
被缩减到最不值钱的部分
is whittled down to its least valuable parts.

473
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,450
然后你就死了
Then you'll die,

474
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,180
凯斯和泰特绝对不可能
and there will be no way for Kayce and certainly not Tate

475
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,620
以此为生
to make a living from it...

476
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,310
就这样  七代人的传承
and just like that, seven generations

477
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:11,770
将被刻在小农场上
of our family legacy will be carved into little ranchettes,

478
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,690
人们来避暑时
where people will spend the summer

479
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,480
会好奇在他们来之前
wondering what this place looked like

480
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:18,090
还是我们家土地的时候  这里长什么样
before they got there when it was ours.

481
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,060
你说的每个字我都信  亲爱的
I don't doubt a word you're saying, honey. Not one.

482
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,180
但我
But I...

483
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,120
我不能卖
I can't sell it.

484
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,790
你不用卖掉农场  爸  只是土地
You wouldn't be selling the ranch, Dad, just the land--

485
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,150
一寸都不行
Not an inch. Not one.

486
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,110
这是他求我的最后一件事
It's the last thing he asked me.

487
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,790
-肯定还有别的办法  -没有了
- There's gotta be another way. - There isn't.

488
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,120
不  总会有办法的
Nah, there's always another way.

489
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:55,940
别让傲气影响你的决定  爸
Please don't let pride factor into this decision, Dad.

490
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,020
这件事太大了
It's just too big.

491
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,880
不是傲气  亲爱的  只是
No pride, honey. It's just...

492
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,720
我发过誓
I made a promise.

493
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,810
我宁愿失去土地也不想违背誓言
And I'd rather lose it than break it.

494
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,890
他宁愿
And he'd rather...

495
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,560
他也宁愿让我失去土地
He'd rather me lose it too.

496
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,210
我去睡觉了  亲爱的
I think I'm gonna turn in for the evening, honey.

497
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,160
好的
Okay.

498
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,150
{\an8}黄石
达顿农场

499
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:57,280
请给我们两罐"黄夹克"
Could we get a couple Yellow Jackets, please.

500
00:42:06,090 --> 00:42:06,950
谢谢
Thank you.

501
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:12,250
为你的夫妻生活  干杯
To your life with her. Cheers.

502
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,960
你在笑
You're smiling.

503
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,550
闭嘴吧
Shut up, will ya?

504
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:26,550
你做了一件没人能做到的事  里普
Well, you know, you did something that no one does, Rip.

505
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:30,430
你走出了过去
You've outlived your past.

506
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,040
也许吧  罗伊德
Maybe so, Lloyd. Maybe so.

507
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,250
*带我去见巫毒女王*
*Take me to see the voodoo queen*

508
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:38,150
*让她对我施咒*
*Let her put a spell on me*

509
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,500
*一点改变来缓解我的痛苦*
*A little bit of change to ease my pain*

510
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,860
*释放一个年轻人*
*Gonna set a young man free*

511
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,410
*我去过你家乡*
*I've been down through your hometown*

512
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,430
*在这片遥远的土地上*
*And all across this distant land*

513
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:53,210
他应该已经死了啊
He's supposed to be dead.

514
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,670
*亲爱的  我要走了*
*Honey, I'll be gone*

515
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,340
*告诉我妈我很想她*
*Tell my mother I miss her so*

516
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,470
*告诉我妈我很想她*
*Tell my mother I miss her so*

517
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:07,680
*告诉我妈我很想她*
*Tell my mother I miss her so*

518
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:12,390
*告诉我妈我很想她*
*Tell my mother I miss her so*
