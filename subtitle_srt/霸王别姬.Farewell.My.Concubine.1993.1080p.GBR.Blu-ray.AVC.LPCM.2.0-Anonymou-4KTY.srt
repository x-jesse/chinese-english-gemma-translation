How could I? We're all equally despised by society.

98
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:04,100
他祖师爷不赏饭吃
But if there's no job for him,

99
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,650

The water's all turned to ice!

103
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,530
娘

I nearly turned a somersault!

121
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:29,300
凡是人的 就得听戏
If you belong to the human race, you go to the opera.

122
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,740
不听戏的 他就不是人
If you don't go to the opera, you're not a human being.

123
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:37,380
什么猪啊 狗啊 它就不听戏
Pigs and dogs don't listen to opera.

124
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
是人吗
And are they human? 

125
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,920
它畜牲
They're beasts!

126
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,050
所以呀 有戏就有咱梨园行
And where there's opera, there's work for us actors!

127

- 别嚷嚷 别嚷嚷 我不爱听  - 我不

立腰
Straighten that back!

130
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:07,290
若想人前显贵 您必得人后受罪
If you think you're above everyone else, you'll learn the hard way.

131
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,900
今儿个是破题 文章还在后头呢
This is just the beginning, wait till you see what's in store!

132
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,300

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,770
朕都耗了一炷香了
They burned a whole stick of incense before I quit.

134

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,900
师傅
But Master,

138
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,800
我练腿眼朝天
I was looking up.

139
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,700
没留神底下
I didn't notice what was on the floor.

140
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,610
废话
Bullshit.

141
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,150
- 取活去 - 噢

你起来
Get up!

147
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,400
怎么啦 你当是完啦
So that's it?

148
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,330
还有一说呐
Don't you have something to say?

149
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,410
是 在班结党者 罚
Yes. "Forming cliques is prohibited and will be punished."

150
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,970
我他妈小癞子 什么都不怕
I'm not fucking scared of anything.

151
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,800
打自有唱戏的行当起
From the time opera began,

152
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,460
每朝哪一代 它也没有咱们京戏 这么红过
it's never enjoyed such popularity as it does today!

153
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,120
你们算是赶上了
You're lucky to be part of it!

154
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,420
没错
For sure!

155
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:05,220
“此乃天亡我楚 非战之罪也”
Heaven's will, not a lack of soldierly skill, has doomed my kingdom.

156
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,540
小爷我今儿练的是 九转金浑火丹功
My little man, I've been practising the Taoist "kung fu of fire".

157
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,040
我到外...外...外边我 凉快 凉快去
It's cool outside, quite cool.

But I've become a man of fire.

159

离...离我远点
Get away from me.

160
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:48,420
“力拔山兮 气盖世”

“骓不逝”

传于我辈门人 诸生须当敬听
These are our rules, we must learn them well.

166
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,470
自古人生于世 需有一技之能
From ancient times, man has needed a skill.

167
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:31,010
我辈既务斯业 便当专心用功

以后名扬四海 根据即在年轻

“回首望天朝 急走忙逃”
I look back at the Celestial Court, and hurry onwards in flight...

172
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:52,340
“顾…顾不得…”
Heedless of... heedless of...

173

“虞姬虞姬 奈若何”

00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,160
不关师哥的事
He didn't have anything to do with it.

307
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:58,970
您打我
Beat me instead!

308
00:27:38,170 --> 00:27:39,450
我叫你跑
I told you to run.

309
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:40,930
你有...
You..

310
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,050
我打死你
I'll kill you.

311
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,330
打死你呀
Kill you ah!

312
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,440
你以为我不敢打你呀
Did you think you wouldn't get yours?

313
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,770
你当我不打你
Did you think you wouldn't get yours?

314
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,470
我打死你
I'll kill you.

315
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:08,560
豆子 说呀 说呀 开口呀
Douzi, speak! Say something!

316
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,240
讨个饶呀 说打得好呀 说呀
Beg for mercy! Say he's beaten you well and truly!

317
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:14,700
我打死你 你跑 你跑
I'll kill you! Run away, will you?

318
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,950
开口 说呀
Speak!

319
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:17,890
打死你
I'll beat you to death if I must.

320
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,050
打死你 咱们散伙儿
I'll beat you to death if I must. Let's just disband the troupe...

321
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,320
打
Beat!

322
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,270
打死你
I'll beat you to death if I must.

323
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,900
你把小豆子打死了
You're killing Douzi!

324
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,280
我跟你拼了
I won't let you do this!

325
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,070
关爷 关爷 可了不得了
Master Guan! Something terrible has happened!

326
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,730
这个 他…死了
Laizi, he...died.

327
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,960
“霸王别姬”
"Farewell My Concubine"

328
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,450
讲的是楚汉相争的故事
tells the story of the struggle between the Chu and Han kings.

329
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,400
楚霸王 何许人也
What sort of man was the King Of Chu?

330
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,000
那是天下无敌的盖世英雄
A peerless and invincible hero,

331
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:02,340
横扫千军的勇将猛帅
a bold and resourceful general capable of defeating vast armies.

332
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,890
可老天却偏偏不成全他
But fate wasn't on his side.

333
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:13,660
在垓下 中了汉军的十面埋伏
At Gaixia he fell into an ambush set by the Han king,

334
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,680
让刘邦给困死了
Liu Bang.

335
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,450
那天晚上 刮着大风
A great wind blew up on that night.

336
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,970
刘邦的兵 唱了一宿的楚歌
Liu Bang's troops sang the songs of the kingdom of Chu all night long.

337
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,820
楚国的人马 以为刘邦得了楚地
The Chu warriors assumed Liu Bang already occupied their homeland.

338
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,090
全都慌了神了 跑光了
In a great panic, they fled.

339
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:35,050
听得霸王 也掉下泪来
Even the king was weeping.

340
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,240
人纵有万般能耐
No matter how resourceful you are,

341
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,360
可终也敌不过天命
you can't fight fate.

342
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:48,140
那霸王风云一世
The king had once been all-powerful,

343
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,540
临到头
but in the end,

344
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,920
就剩下了 一匹马和一个女人 还跟着他
all he had left was one woman and one horse.

345
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,630
霸王让乌骓马逃命 乌骓马不去
He tried to get his steed to run away, but it wouldn't go.

346
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,160
让虞姬走人 虞姬不肯
He wanted his concubine to flee, but she stayed too.

347
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,550
那虞姬 最后一次为霸王斟酒
For the very last time, Concubine Yu poured wine for her king

348
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,940
最后一回 为霸王舞剑
and danced for him with a sword,

349
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:16,160
尔后 拔剑自刎 从一而终啊
then cut her throat with it, faithful to the king unto death.

350
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,450
讲这出戏
There's a lesson...

351
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,260
是这里边 有个唱戏和做人的道理
...in this story for all of us

352
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:31,320
人 得自个儿成全自个儿
that each person is responsible for his or her own fate.

353
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:47,920
“力拔山兮” 
I am so strong I can uproot the mountains,

354
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:53,840
“气盖世”
My courage is renowned.

355
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:01,900
“时不利兮”
I've fallen on bad times,

356
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:06,780
“骓不逝”
Yet even my horse won't run away to save itself

357
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,920
张宅上 把订戏的差 委了您…
Old Man Zhang has commissioned you to hire an opera troupe.

358
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,990
那您就是 我们喜福成的衣食父母
You're like a fairy godmother to us.

359
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,810
啊 您抬举抬举呢
With your patronage,

360
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:26,370
孩子们年下 就穿上新衣裳了
the children will have new clothes to wear in the New Year.

361
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,210
衣裳的事 好穿
New clothes are not a problem.

362
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,960
戏活难做
The opera, however, is no simple matter.

363
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:33,670
诶 对啊
Yes.

364
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,180
张公公 那是当年
When he was a palace eunuch, Old Man Zhang...

365
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,450
陪太后老佛爷 听过戏的主儿
...attended operas with the Empress Dowager herself.

366
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:38,400
那是 那是
That's it.

367
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:39,860
糊弄得了吗
So you can't put anything over on him.

368
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,040
敢吗
Not that anyone would try!

369
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,700
玩艺儿要是不灵 新衣裳…
You realise that if this little number doesn't make the grade,

370
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,000
砸了我的脸面 没什么
I could lose a lot of face, but that's nothing.

371
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,670
- 像您这样的 - 啊
- He could... - Me?

372
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,570
能把您给囚起来
He could have you locked up!

373
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,390
- 这孩子 有点意思啊 - 啊
- This kid's got something. - What?

374
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,240
学几年戏啦 啊
How many years has he been in training?

375
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,690
小豆子 快 快 过来 过来
Douzi, come here...

376
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,240
来给经...经理请安啦
...and pay your respects.

377
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,770
嗯
Oh,

378
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,890
身段 也还不错
He's got a nice little figure, too.

379
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,940
有点昆腔儿的底儿没有啊
Can you sing any old-style operas?

380
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,970
诶... 学了两出
Yes, two.

381
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,950
男怕“夜奔” 女怕“思凡”
"Dreaming of the World Outside the Nunnery" is the hardest female role.

382
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:33,200
就来段“思凡”吧
Let's hear a bit of it.

383
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,010
“小尼姑 年方二八”
At sixteen I am a nun

384

“正青春 被师傅削去了头发”

385
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:51,660
“我本是男儿郎 又不是女娇娥”
Yet I am by nature a boy, not a girl

386
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:53,940
“为何…”
Why...

387
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,220

00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,600
- 回头见 改日再见 - 这孩子平常不是这样的
- This kid doesn't usually do that. - Master Guan, I'll see you some other time.

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,380
“我本是…”
I am...

398
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,400
“我本是女娇娥 又不是…”
I am by nature a girl, not a boy...

399
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,360

402
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:44,600

Why must I wear these sexless robes?

403

“见人家夫妻们洒落”
I see the joyful couples pass

404
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:51,290
“一对对着锦穿罗 不由人心急似火”
In their splendid brocades. Despite myself, desire burns in my heart.

405
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,440
“奴把袈裟扯破”
And I rend my Buddhist gown!

406
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,420
“自从我...”
For year upon year,

407
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:00,930
“随大王…”
all over the land, I've followed my king...

408
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:13,560
“东征西战…”
...on his military campaigns

409
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:35,540
“受风霜与劳碌 年复年年…”
Enduring the wind, And frost and hard toil

410
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,620
“恨只恨无道秦”
I hate only the lawless tyrant,

411
00:36:43,850 --> 00:37:00,520
“把生灵涂炭”
Who has plunged our people into an abyss of misery!

412

415
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:22,520
“只害得众百姓痛苦颠连”
The people have suffered, Untold hardship and pain

416
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,140
“大王回营呀”
The King has returned to the camp!

417
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,360

“此一番 连累你 多受惊慌”
I've caused you so much grief

423
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,770
早就把刘邦给宰了
he'd have wiped out Liu Bang ages ago!

424

00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,560
慢着
Don't run...

431
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,360
来了 来了 来了
Here we are.

眉毛这儿 汗一蛰 生疼

俩孩子 一块儿去吧
Aren't the two kids going in together?

435
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,850
老规矩了
No.

关师傅
Master Guan,

438
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,440
这您不明白 就说不过去了
Master Guan, if you don't understand, there's nothing I can say.

439
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,260

The concubine...

可她也得有一死不是
The concubine has to die one way or the other.

00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,020
您说呢
Isn't it so?

00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,300
师傅…

00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:32,140
你这样的往里头撒 不算糟塌东西
You won't harm anything.

457
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,360
来
Come over.

458
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,790
诶...来呀
Come to me!

459
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,940
豆子
Douzi!

460
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:57,230
关老板
Master Guan.

461
00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:00,760
- 张公公 让我谢谢您 - 你怎么了 说话呀
- Mr. Zhang asked me to thank you. - What's happened to you? Say something!

462
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,460
哑巴啦
Have you gone dumb?

463
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,700
说话呀
Speak to me!

464
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,720
小豆子
Douzi,

465
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,850
一个人 有一个人的命
fate has determined each of our lots.

466
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,380
你还是把他 放回去吧
Leave him to his destiny.

467
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:23,970
好了…好勒...
All right,

468
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,620
瞧这儿…
look at the camera!

469
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,170
二位老板 少年裘马
You two young gentlemen have done grandly for yourselves.

470
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,200
甭管穿什么衣裳 什么款式
You look so dignified, absolutely striking,

471
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,500
只要一上身 保管你都体面 都标致
in any style of clothing.

472
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,450
好
That's it!

473
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,840
好
That's it!

474
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,720
“反对日本增兵华北”
Oppose Japan's invasion of North China!

475
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:06,510
糟了糟了 又是那些学生
Damn! It's those students again.

476
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:24,320
“保卫华北 打倒日本帝国主义”
Down with Japanese imperialism! Death is preferable to enslavement!

477
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,810
喂 这不是照片上那俩戏子吗
Aren't those the two actors in the photograph?

478
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,610
眼瞅就要当亡国奴了 你知道吗
Don't you know you're playing into the hands of the Japanese?

479
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,760
妖里妖气的 你唱什么戏
Yeah, how can you tart yourself up and sing opera at a time like this?

480
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,100
没家没国的 你们有没有中国人的良心
Don't you have the least bit of feeling for your country?

481
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,870
都看清楚啦 啊
Take a good look.

482
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,880
这是正经八百的中国人
We're Chinese too. Chinese to the core!

483
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,800
你们他妈都给我 看清楚了
Look at us, goddamn it!

484
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,200
没错 没错 正经八百中国人
That's right, that's right, we're all Chinese here!

485
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,490
中国人不打中国人
Chinese mustn't fight among themselves!

486
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,850
中国人不打中国人
Chinese mustn't fight among themselves!

487
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,650
都是一个老祖宗
We're all descended from the same ancestors!

488
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,340
都是一个老祖宗
We're all descended from the same ancestors!

489
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,300
老祖宗错得了吗 错不了 错不了
And don't you forget it!

490
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,260
一个个都他妈忠臣良将的模样
Every goddamn one of them thinks he's a super-patriot.

491
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:12,110
这日本兵就在城外头 打去呀
The Japanese soldiers aren't far away, they should go fight them.

492
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,850
敢情欺负的还是中国人呀
Instead, they pick on fellow Chinese!

493
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,570
瞎哄呗 学生们不都没娶过媳妇吗
They're just looking for trouble. None of them have married yet,

494
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:21,310
火气壮 又没钱找姑娘
and they've got no money to get any girls,

495
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:24,510
总得找个地界 撒撒火气是不是 你说
so they've got to let off steam somehow.

496
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,160
领着喊的那个 唱武生倒不错
Their leader would make a good player of military roles!

497
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:30,570
诶
Hey,

498
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:33,470
咱们第一出"别姬" 在哪儿唱的来着
Where was it that we first performed "Farewell"?

499
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,960
这驴年马月的事 全让你记住了
You usually remember every silly little detail.

500
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,300
诶诶...段老板 您这不能忘啰
Oh, Mr Duan, I remember.

501
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,460
那不张公公府上堂会吗
It was at the home of Old Man Zhang.

502
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,930
我保的二位小爷嘛
My good men,

503
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,850
- 二位的发祥宝地 是不  - 那是
- it was from there that your careers took off! - Yes.

504
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:46,850
蝶衣
Dieyi,

505
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,820
那儿现成了棺材铺了
Zhang's home is now a coffin shop!

506
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,490
我昨儿刚去的
I went there just yesterday.

507
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,120
又去找那把剑去了 是不
You were looking for that sword, weren't you?

508
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,720
早不知卖哪儿去了
It was probably sold off years ago.

509
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:06,010
程蝶衣…程蝶衣…
Cheng Dieyi! Cheng Dieyi!

510
00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:09,400
冰糖葫芦
Candied crab-apples for sale!

511
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,590
冰糖葫芦
Candied crab-apples for sale!

512
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,610
座是汪洋汪海…
There's a sea of awestruck people in there

513
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,380
一个个都伸着脖子 
craning their necks to catch...

514
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:20,150
等着赡仰 您二位风采呢
...a glimpse of their idols.

515
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:21,910
袁四爷
Master Yuan...

516
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,260
专门捧您的场子
...has come specially to see you perform tonight.

517
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,920
您这面子 天大的去了
It's a great honour for us.

518
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,340
马后 马后…没扮上呢
There'll be a slight delay!

519
00:46:58,310 --> 00:46:59,030
段老板
Mr Duan...

520
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:02,020
急急风催半天了
The orchestra's been warming up for ages.

521
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:03,430
您再紧把手
Please hurry!

522
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,410
知道了 知道了
I know. I know.

523
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,750
我先亮一嗓子
Let me first practise a few scales.

524
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,010
让他们知道 票没白买 不就得了
That way they'll know they'll be getting their money's worth.

525
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:16,770
四爷
Master Yuan!

526
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,560
“自从我”
Year after year, all over the land,

527
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:47,260
“随大王东征西战”
I've followed my king on his military campaigns

528
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:13,300
“受风霜与劳碌年复年年”
Enduring the wind, And frost and hard toil

529
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,240
四爷 您说到没到
You judge...

530
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,160
那人戏不分 雌雄同在的境界
has he not blurred the distinction between theatre and life...

531
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,000
您给断断
male and female?

532
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:33,130
“恨...恨...”
I hate...

533
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,560
“大王”
Your Highness!

534
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,500
“此一番连累你”
I've caused you...

535
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:13,400
“多受惊慌”
...so much grief

536
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:22,160
诶 袁四爷今儿个 来捧场了
So, Master Yuan has come to see us tonight.

537
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,610
没听见我盖着哨呐唱吗
Didn't you hear me sing so loudly I drowned out the horns?

538
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,900
把血都挣出来了
My face went red.

539
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,500
我就让他听明白了
But I wanted him to know that without his patronage,

540
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,070
没他四爷的捧场
we'd still be the talk...

541
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:35,480
咱在北平 也照唱照红
...of the town here in Peiping.

542
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,010
那你也悠着点
You shouldn't exert yourself like that.

543
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:38,260
没事儿
Don't worry.

544
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,180
到了裉节上
At key moments,

545
00:49:40,730 --> 00:49:42,350
我两手轮着撑在腰里
I squeezed my waist with my hands

546
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,050
帮着提气
so I wouldn't get out of breath.

547
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,830
这儿
Here?

548
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:47,770
不对
No.

549
00:49:49,230 --> 00:49:49,890
这儿
Here?

550
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:50,760
嗯
Yes.

551
00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:54,300
- 这儿 - 唉哟 我不行 你别闹
- Here! - Stop it!

552
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:10,580
哟 四爷
Master Yuan!

553
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,530
久仰久仰
It's an honour.

554
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:15,880
二位果然是不负盛名
Your reputation turns out to be well-deserved.

555
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:16,810
四爷
Master Yuan!

556
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:18,220
您捧场
You're very kind.

557
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:29,680
唐突了点
Please accept a small,

558
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,890
算是见面礼
rather slapdash token of my esteem.

559
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,710
哎哟喂
Oh, hello

560
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:47,870
都说当年太后老佛爷
I don't believe the Empress Dowager herself ever

561
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,710
诶 她老人家赏戏 有这样的手面吗
bestowed such a gift upon her favourite actors.

562
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:52,910
有吗
If so,

563
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:54,670
没有吧
I'd never heard of it!

564
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,820
四爷
Master Yuan,

565
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,800
您这让我们蝶衣 怎么当得起啊
how can our Dieyi be worthy of your favour?

566
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,140
“霸王别姬”这一折
"Farewell My Concubine"...

567
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,140
渊源已久
...has a long history.

568
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,060
本是从昆剧老本
It evolved from...

569
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,040
“千金记”里脱胎出来的
...the old-style opera "The Gold Strategy".

570
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,040
好多名家 都在这出上唱栽过
Many famous actors have fallen down in this role.

571
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,840
独你程老板的虞姬
Your evocation of the Concubine Yu...

572
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,960
快入纯青之境
...lifts it into a higher realm.

573
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,380
有点意思
Impressive.

574
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,440
有那么一二刻
For a moment or two,

575
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,440
袁某也恍惚起来
this Yuan fellow was so entranced

576
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,460
疑为虞姬 转世再现啦
he believed Concubine Yu had actually come back to life!

577
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:00,380
段老板…
Mr Duan...

578
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,290
霸王回营亮相
when the king returns to camp...

579
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,500
到和虞姬相见
...and meets Concubine Yu,

580
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,300
按老规矩…
custom has it...

581
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,340
是 四爷
Yes, Master Yuan.

582
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,670
按老规矩是定然七步 你只走了五步
Custom has it he takes seven steps. Yet you take but five.

583
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,210
楚霸王 气度尊贵
If the King of Chu fails to bear himself with majestic dignity,

584
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,670
要是威而不重
he's little better than...

585
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:25,900
不成了江湖上的黄天霸了
...a gangster putting on airs!

586
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:27,800
四爷
Master Yuan,

587
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,810
您梨园大拿呀
you are a master of the theatre arts.

588
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,400
文武昆乱不挡 六场通透
You are expert in all the varieties and facets of opera.

589
00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:35,130
您能有错吗
Could we doubt your word?

590
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,300
- 哦 - 您要是都出了错
- Yes. - Indeed,

591
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,840
那我们兄弟 这点玩艺儿…
we are presumptuous to parade our meagre talents...

592
00:52:41,310 --> 00:52:42,810
还敢在北平的戏园子里露吗
in the theatres of Peiping.

593
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:44,910
四爷 您得栽培我们
Please give us the benefit of your advice and criticism.

594
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,550
如不嫌弃
If it's not beneath you,

595
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:53,690
请二位到舍下 小酌几杯 然后细谈
 I'd like to invite you to my humble home for some wine.

596
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,790
实话说
There is...

597
00:52:56,530 --> 00:52:59,370
这出戏的学问 还真是不浅
There is so much still to be said about this opera.

598
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:00,410
哟 四爷
Master Yuan,

599
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,360
对您不住
I'm terribly sorry.

600
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,840
赶巧了
Sorry!

601
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,260
我得…
I've another...

602
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,320
喝一壶花酒去
...drinking engagement with a courtesan.

603
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,030
另有雅趣
You have other refined entertainments planned!

604
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,380
好
Excellent!

605
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,160
程老板呢
And Mr Cheng?

606
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:24,620
我...
Me...

607
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,640
那么日后踏雪访梅
Then we shall exchange poetic thoughts...

608
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,740
再谈不迟
...some other day.

609
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:38,500
失陪了

赶出来了
I was kicked out.

767
01:06:15,210 --> 01:06:17,280
花满楼 不留许过婚的人
The House of Blossoms won't keep an engaged woman.

768
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:24,910
程老板 程老板
Mr Cheng,

常听小楼念叨您
Xiaolou speaks of you so often,

776

听都听成熟人了
I feel like we're old friends.

777

噢 菊仙小姐 失陪了
Ah, Miss Juxian. I must be going.

778
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:09,080
小楼
Xiaolou,

779
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:12,430
那天在花满楼
that day at the House of Blossoms...

780
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,830
要不是 你在楼底下接着
If you hadn't caught me,

781
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,600
我早就入土了
I'd be six feet under by now.

782
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:26,490
那杯定亲酒 可是你先喝了一半
Remember, it was you who proposed to me.

783
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,580
菊仙命苦
I'm used to hardship.

784
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,420
你要是收留她
If you take me in...

785
01:07:32,290 --> 01:07:33,900
有人当牛做马 侍侯你
I'll wait on you hand and foot.

786
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:37,260
你要是嫌弃她
If you tire of me,

787
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,000
大不了 她再跳回楼
I'll jump again and kill myself. No big deal, really.

788
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,940
这妞可够厉害的
What a dragon lady!

789
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,430
服 我服 啊

我得堂堂正正地 进你段家的门

798
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:30,600
嫌我偷工减料啊

那成 今儿晚上就是定亲礼

我哪儿学过戏呀
Me, study opera? What makes you think I studied opera?

805
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,760
没学过呀 那就别洒狗血了
Just the way you're overplaying your part.

806
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,480
蝶衣
Dieyi,

807

I'd like you to be best man.

811
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:18,320
黄天霸和妓女的戏 不会演
I haven't learnt the opera "Gangster King and his Whore".

812
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:22,030
师傅没教过
Our teacher never taught us that one.

813
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,400
这...这是哪儿和哪儿呢
What are you on about?

814
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:25,600
师弟
Dieyi,

815
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,600
小楼在人前人后提起您来
Xiaolou has never said an ill word about you

816
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:31,150
说的 可都是厚道话儿
in public or private.

817
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:36,800
别走
Don't leave!

818
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,340
你上哪儿去
Where are you going?

819
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:47,940
我上哪儿去 你管得着吗
None of your business.

820
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,900

821
01:09:53,330 --> 01:09:54,610

He wants to become our patron.

824
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,120
姓袁的 他管得着姓段的吗
Who does he think he is? No one tells me what to do.

825
01:10:07,630 --> 01:10:11,020
我是假霸王 你是真虞姬
I'm just a fake king. You really are Concubine Yu.

826

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,640
这对翎子 难得
A headdress of this quality is a rare thing.

830
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:52,090
是从活雉鸡的尾巴上 生生收取的
Only if plucked from the tail of a live pheasant

831
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:55,710
这才够柔软

832
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,280
够伶俐
lithe...

833

尘世中
In this world,

836
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:49,140
男子阳污 女子阴秽
there is foulness in both men and women.

837
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:54,220
独观世音 集两者之精 于一身
Only the Bodhisattva embodies both male and female essences.

838
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,110
欢喜无量啊

01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:18,640
这把剑 有些来历
This sword has a history.

840
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,240
是大太监张某的旧物
It once belonged to the eunuch Zhang.

841
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,720
张家破败时
When Zhang went bankrupt,

842
01:12:25,010 --> 01:12:27,780
是费了大周折 弄到手的
I went to great trouble to acquire it.

843
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:31,150
如此看来…
I can see from this

844
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,330
此物是你的旧相识了
you're old acquaintances.

845
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,380
果然世上的事
Amazing, one searches far and wide for something...

846
01:12:39,970 --> 01:12:43,240
是踏破铁鞋无觅处啊
...only to stumble upon it by chance.

847
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:52,380
喜欢
Like it?

848
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:54,770
我…
I...

849
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:00,720
你我之间不言钱 那个字眼实在不雅
Let's not have any vulgar talk of money between us.

850
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:06,320
自古宝剑酬知已
A precious sword is the classic gift for one's most intimate friend.

851
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:10,030

01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:14,670
愿做我的红尘知己吗
Mr Cheng, will you be my most intimate friend?

853
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:24,900
“汉兵已略地”
The soldiers of Han have invaded

854
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:34,840
“四面楚歌声”
The songs of Chu can be heard on all sides

855
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:35,670

不
No.

857
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:47,480

859
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:06,290
别动
Don't!

A smile ushers in the spring...

862
01:14:36,290 --> 01:14:40,180
一啼万古愁
A tear does darken all the world.

863
01:14:42,510 --> 01:14:45,760

How truly does this befit you...

864
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:53,950
此貌 非你莫有
Only you are possessed of such charm.

01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,840
又不上台
But we're not on stage.

877

要剑干什么
What would I want with a sword?

878
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:22,860
啊
Why?

879
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,480

嘿 别呀 我的程老板 这可不能够

889
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,250
这不是 让人笑话吗
Isn't this funny?

890
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,020
戏迷们 还不得要…

你得乖乖的给扒下来

听明白了吗 戏子
Get my meaning? Low-life actor!

慢着喔
Hold on a tick!

924
01:21:19,730 --> 01:21:21,960
这哪儿是什么堂会呀
It's not some private party.

925
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:25,330
这就是讹您啦 去给他们唱一回去
It's a blackmail.

926
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:30,240
您说这不去吧 眼下能救小楼的
On the one hand, you're the only one...

927
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:31,830
除了您 没旁人了
...who can save Xiaolou.

928
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:33,800
您要是去吧
On the other,

929
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:37,010
万一您自个儿 再出点什么差池
if anything happened to you...

930
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:39,680
我这个戏园子 我去...
this theatre of mine, it would...

931
01:21:41,590 --> 01:21:42,600
诶 得
All right,

932
01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:44,140
好 去 去 啊 去
All right, go then.

933
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:46,750
诶 菊仙小姐 菊仙小姐 您干什么 小的...
Miss Juxian, what are you doing? I...

934
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:48,390
小姐 程老板不在家
Miss, Miss... Mr Cheng isn't at home!

935
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:50,720
蝶衣呢
Where's Dieyi? Dieyi?

936
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:52,860
蝶衣 你赶紧的呀
Hurry!

937
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:53,960
都说日本人
They say the Japanese...

938
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,350
会放狼狗 掏人心吃
...let their dogs eat the hearts right out of people's chests.

939
01:21:56,170 --> 01:21:57,230
他又是那个脾气
And you know Xiaolou's temper.

940
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:59,120
你要去晚了 他可就没命啦
If you delay, he mightn't have a life to save!

941
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,370
师弟
Dieyi!

942
01:22:15,620 --> 01:22:19,360
我师哥 可是在您的手上 让人逮走的
But you allowed them to take him away in the first place.

943
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,170
诶 你这是什么话嘛
What are you saying?

944
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:25,090
小楼打小 是怎么待你的
Xiaolou has looked after you since you were small.

945
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:31,350
您知道就好
Glad you're aware of that too.

946
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:49,410
那爷
Mr Na,

947
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,470
诶 嘿
Right.

948
01:22:50,570 --> 01:22:52,240
请您先退一步
would you mind leaving the room for a moment?

949
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:52,830
诶 好
Okay!

950
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:55,490
我跟我师弟 有几句私房话要说
I have something to say to Dieyi in private.

951
01:22:57,290 --> 01:22:59,250
都说菊仙姑娘聪明
Everyone says Miss Juxian is quite clever,

952
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:01,110
不然不能这时候来
and her timing in this case certainly proves it.

953
01:23:02,120 --> 01:23:03,680
都是为了小楼 啊
We're all trying to help Xiaolou.

954
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,750
有话好商量 诶
Talk it over.

955
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:11,220
干脆明说了吧
How about a clear answer,

956
01:23:12,290 --> 01:23:13,940
 您倒是去 还是不去
are you going or not?

957
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:34,460
说话呀 你
Say something!

958
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:45,520
我明白你的心思
I know what's on your mind.

959
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:48,650
要不这么着吧
I have a proposal.

960
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,750
你只要囫囵个地 把小楼给弄出来
If you can get Xiaolou out of there in one piece,

961
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:56,510
我哪来哪去 回我的花满楼
I'll go back to the House of Blossoms.

962
01:23:58,070 --> 01:23:59,450
躲你们俩远远的
I'll keep away from both of you then.

963
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:01,820
成了吧
How's that?

964
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:07,050
要说在花满楼
At the House of Blossoms,

965
01:24:08,650 --> 01:24:10,670
还真是个不操闲心的地方
you don't have to worry about much.

966
01:24:13,730 --> 01:24:15,220
日子过得轻省多了
Life is a lot simpler there.

967
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:24,450
这可是您自个儿说的
Just remember, you said it, not me.

968
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:27,290
一言为定
I give my word.

969
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:52,420
“姹紫嫣红开遍”
The flowers have blossomed, Their season's past

970
01:24:53,370 --> 01:25:18,130
“似这般 都付于断井颓垣”
All has fallen, into ruin and decay

971
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:34,000
“良辰美景奈何天”
The sun shines brightly, over the beautiful scene

972
01:25:34,220 --> 01:25:59,630
“便赏心乐事谁家院”
But is there anyone left, to enjoy it?

973
01:26:05,640 --> 01:26:07,060
- 小楼呢 - 哎呀 小楼
- Where is Xiaolou? - Xiaolou! 

974
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,220
师哥
My brother!

975
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,120
- 师哥 - 小楼
- Bro. - Xiaolou!

976
01:26:12,540 --> 01:26:13,260
师哥
My brother!

977
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,260
小楼 你没事吧
Xiaolou, are you all right?

978
01:26:15,450 --> 01:26:16,450
你给日本人唱了
Did you sing for the Japanese?

979
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:17,700
有个叫青木的
There's one called Aoki.

980
01:26:17,860 --> 01:26:18,970
他是懂戏的
He's quite a fan of Peking Opera

981
01:26:20,700 --> 01:26:21,460
小楼 你
Xiaolou!

982
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:30,420
举枪
Raise a gun!

983
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:33,910
发射
Fire!

984
01:28:08,180 --> 01:28:09,190
我好了
All right.

985
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:11,220
来吧
Come here!

986
01:28:11,310 --> 01:28:12,450
我再喝一杯
Let me have another drink.

987
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:15,520
对不起 我…我替你喝
I... I'll drink for you.

988
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:25,490
嗯 来
Come on!

989
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,560
这就是“霸王别姬”
I think this opera "Farewell My Concubine"

990
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:08,670
依我之见
has turned...

991
01:29:09,890 --> 01:29:11,970
你们这戏 演到这份儿上
...into...

992
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:14,190
竟成了姬别霸王
..."Farewell My King".

993
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:16,470
没霸王什么看头
The king doesn't really get a look in.

994
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:35,930
喝了它
Drink this...

995
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:39,570
您定能纤音入云
and your voice will pierce the heavens,

996
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:41,660
柔情胜水
yet be tender and fluid as water.

997
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:48,960
别动
Don't move!

998
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:54,230
好
Right.

999
01:30:30,270 --> 01:30:31,460
不唱戏了
Forget the opera.

1000
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:34,760
往后啊
Let's just...

1001
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,870
我太太平平地跟你过日子
live a quiet life.

1002
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,180
再生个大胖小子
We'll have a fat little baby boy.

1003
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:43,640
我一下得俩
And I'll have everything I want.

1004
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:46,190
够了
That's enough.

1005
01:30:48,500 --> 01:30:49,550
不唱戏了
No more opera.

1006
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:24,180
哎 走 走…
Let's go.

1007
01:31:24,370 --> 01:31:25,950
赶紧走 弄一个破虫子
Hurry up! Take those wretched insects!

1008
01:31:26,070 --> 01:31:27,590
大哥 我走了 再见啊
See you, pal.

1009
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:28,390
行了 行了…
All right, all right!

1010
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:30,300
嘿
Hey,

1011
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:32,460
拿出来
Hand it over!

1012
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:35,230
谁要你这破蛐蛐
I'm not talking about your stupid crickets.

1013
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:36,870
你借他的钱呢
Where's the money he lent you?

1014
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:37,870
我这是...
I...

1015
01:31:38,440 --> 01:31:40,430
你别看他今儿个高兴 想讹他
Don't think you can take advantage of him when he's in a good mood.

1016
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:43,390
把钱拿出来 赶紧的
Give me the money and get lost.

1017
01:31:45,830 --> 01:31:48,290
玩蛐蛐 大爷乐意
I'm the one who wanted them.

1018
01:31:49,520 --> 01:31:50,270
赶紧走吧
Piss off!

1019
01:31:54,830 --> 01:31:56,820
站起来 都是七尺高的老爷们儿
A man's no longer a man if he gives up a proper job

1020
01:31:57,550 --> 01:31:58,990
放正经营生 不做
to waste all his time...

1021
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:00,950
在一个小虫子身上找饭摺
...on these stupid insects.

1022
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:01,990
德行
Disgusting!

1023
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,360
正经营生
A proper job?

1024
01:32:06,170 --> 01:32:07,590
我姓段的就会唱戏
All I can do is sing

1025
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:09,940
啊 戏你不让我唱了
and you won't stand for that.

1026
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:11,660
我不玩蛐蛐 我干嘛去啊
What am I supposed to do?

1027
01:32:12,630 --> 01:32:14,080
我抬棺材 掏大粪去
Find work as a pallbearer? A night soil carrier?

1028
01:32:14,430 --> 01:32:15,040
我...
I...

1029
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:16,860
我放...
I throw...

1030
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:21,770
得 这下您乐了吧
Would that make you happy?

1031
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:24,770
瞧你
Look at you!

1032
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:27,330
真生气啦
You're really angry?

1033
01:32:28,500 --> 01:32:29,220
拿着
Take this back.

1034
01:32:30,840 --> 01:32:31,780
你还没完啦
Not through yet?

1035
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,680
得
Right.

1036
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:36,780
算我话说重了 成了吧
So I overstated things a bit. OK?

1037
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,050
哎 你要是不这么着啊
If you're not careful,

1038
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:43,440
他们就像那狗尿苔似的 长咱们家了
these people will be all over us like fungus.

1039
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:46,620
诶
Hey,

1040
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,700
科班那个 关老爷子说 让你去哪
Oh, your old teacher wants you to go see him.

1041
01:32:49,590 --> 01:32:51,560
不去 没脸见师傅
I'm not going. I'm too ashamed of myself.

1042
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:05,320
“看那剑”
Look at that sword!

1043
01:33:11,290 --> 01:33:13,670
老爷子 他们都到了
Sir, they're here!

1044
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:16,360
谁呀
Who?

1045
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:17,950
蝶衣 小楼
Dieyi and Xiaolou.

1046
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,450
您一叫 他们立马就来 看您来啦
They came as soon as they heard you wanted to see them.

1047
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:25,040
哎哟 这可怎么了不得了
Oh, this really is something!

1048
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:25,630
师傅
Master!

1049
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:28,240
是两位角儿来啦
The two famous actors are here!

1050
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:28,810
徒弟该死
We are unworthy of you.

1051
01:33:28,810 --> 01:33:29,800
哎哟
Ah.

1052
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:33,450
- 师父 - 我这面子天大了去啦
- Master, - You really have given me a lot of face.

1053
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:34,300
哎
Ah.

1054
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,350
我这怎么当得起
I'm deeply honoured.

1055
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:37,870
啊 请坐 请坐
Please, have a seat.

1056
01:33:38,190 --> 01:33:40,680
受老朽一拜啊
Let this decrepit old man pay his respects.

1057
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:42,000
徒弟不敢
Master, your students wouldn't presume...

1058
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:47,530
不敢
Wouldn't presume!

1059
01:33:49,030 --> 01:33:51,120
而今 什么你们不敢
What wouldn't you presume?

1060
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:54,580
程蝶衣
Cheng Dieyi,

1061
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:01,780
当初 是你师哥把你 成全出来的
Cheng Dieyi, Xiaolou helped make you what you are today.

1062
01:34:03,240 --> 01:34:07,090
现在 你师哥不唱戏了
Now he's not singing anymore.

1063
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:12,700
你也该拉他一把吧
It's time for you to give him a hand.

1064
01:34:17,130 --> 01:34:18,460
快着点啊
Come on!

1065
01:34:27,650 --> 01:34:29,320
给我动手啊
Do it!

1066
01:34:41,730 --> 01:34:43,170
小豆子
Little Douzi!

1067
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:46,280
小石头
Little Shitou!

1068
01:34:48,570 --> 01:34:51,520
你们俩起小 这点故事
There's been a lot of water under the bridge

1069
01:34:52,650 --> 01:34:55,100
话说来长啦
since you were children.

1070
01:34:58,530 --> 01:34:59,440
怎么啊
Now,

1071
01:35:00,240 --> 01:35:03,890
现在成角儿了 谱大了
you're great actors. You're too big for your britches.

1072
01:35:04,770 --> 01:35:05,450
啊
Why?

1073
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:07,540
就什么都忘了
But have you forgotten?

1074
01:35:08,730 --> 01:35:13,380
到了这个时候 就不忍心 啊
Don't you have the heart for it anymore?

1075
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:23,370
你要喜欢就纵着他 不许护着他
Did I tell you to spoil and indulge him?

1076
01:35:24,380 --> 01:35:25,870
我叫你看着他
Did I tell you to sit by...

1077
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:27,060
糟塌戏
while he wastes his talents?

1078
01:35:27,250 --> 01:35:28,140
诶 诶
Hey, hey.

1079
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:29,950
我叫你看着他

Go do what you have to do.

1237
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:26,890
你这师弟呀
I don't know whether...

1238
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:30,530
也不知道这世道 跟他找别扭呢
...Dieyi goes looking for trouble...

1239
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:33,220
还是他跟这个世道 找别扭
...or if it's trouble that comes looking for him.

1240
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,920
总是轻省不了
But there seems no avoiding it.

1241
01:47:36,290 --> 01:47:37,540
早晚还得出乱子
Sooner or later, he'll come to grief.

1242
01:47:38,920 --> 01:47:40,220
只要你跟他在一起
Whenever you're with him,

1243
01:47:42,010 --> 01:47:43,300
我这心里 就不踏实
my heart's in my throat.

1244
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:49,760
咱们的孩子没了
Now I've lost our child,

1245
01:47:52,750 --> 01:47:54,330
我可就剩你一人了
you're all I have left.

1246
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,130
往后跟你一起去要饭 我都没二话
I don't care if I have to beg with you on the streets,

1247
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:00,980
可就有一样
all I ask...

1248
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:03,120
小楼
Xiaolou,

1249
01:48:05,140 --> 01:48:07,760
你得让我这心里 太太平平的
all I ask is peace of mind.

1250
01:48:13,730 --> 01:48:14,970
你把他救出来了
If you help him now,

1251
01:48:15,170 --> 01:48:16,670
咱们可就不欠他的了
we'll no longer owe him anything.

1252
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:18,590
往后你别跟他唱了
Don't perform with him anymore.

1253
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:22,810
你答应我
Promise me this.

1254
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:25,920
你得给我立字据呀
Put it in writing.

1255
01:48:26,170 --> 01:48:26,890
啊
Ok?

1256
01:48:54,830 --> 01:48:55,520
四爷
Master Yuan,

1257
01:48:57,130 --> 01:48:58,900
蝶衣这条性命
Dieyi's life...

1258
01:48:59,470 --> 01:49:01,760
可就全仰仗您啦
...in your hands.

1259
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:04,760
这点 您先打点着
Count this.

1260
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:08,180
但凡不够 咱们回头再… 是吧
If it's not enough...

1261
01:49:08,290 --> 01:49:10,010
- 啊 - 诶 诶 哼

1262
01:49:10,430 --> 01:49:11,200
袁四爷
Master Yuan,

1263
01:49:12,120 --> 01:49:13,560
您只要是救出蝶衣
If only you'll save Dieyi,

1264
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:17,380
我们哥俩三年的包银 全归了您
we'll give you all our earnings for the next three years.

1265
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:18,410
哼
Hum.

1266
01:49:18,810 --> 01:49:21,740
没你们的包银 你当我就喂不起这几只鸟啊
You think I need your money to keep my birds from starving?

1267
01:49:27,260 --> 01:49:28,180
这位是
And this gentleman is...?

1268
01:49:30,890 --> 01:49:32,170

Don't you recognise Xiaolou?

01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:33,360
那什么
What's that,

1270
01:49:35,370 --> 01:49:37,820
给蝶衣唱霸王 那段小楼啊
He plays the king to Dieyi's concubine.

1271
01:49:41,080 --> 01:49:42,720
那该他救虞姬去呀
Then it should be he who saves Concubine Yu!

1272
01:49:44,520 --> 01:49:47,160
呀 我的亲老爷子呐 那不是戏吗
My dear man, that's only a play!

1273
01:49:48,050 --> 01:49:49,430
可着全北平
All Peiping knows that...

1274
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,860
谁不知道袁四爷 才是梨园行的真霸王呀
...Master Yuan is the true king of the theatre!

1275
01:49:53,410 --> 01:49:54,120
是吗
Is that so?

1276
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:55,830
噢 是 是
It's true.

1277
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:57,050
是
It's true.

1278
01:49:57,170 --> 01:50:00,130
诶 这说到戏 我倒要请教段老板
Speaking of theatre, I'd like to ask Mr Duan something.

1279
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:05,150
这霸王回营亮过相 去见这虞姬
When the king returns to see Concubine Yu...

1280
01:50:07,540 --> 01:50:09,150
到底该走几步啊
How many steps should he take?

1281
01:50:13,100 --> 01:50:13,850
七步
Seven.

1282
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,800

Show me.

1283
01:50:20,260 --> 01:50:21,290

Master Yuan...

1285
01:50:28,210 --> 01:50:30,130
诶 这是什么 什么 干吗啊
What is this for?  What are you doing?

1286
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:35,340
这是袁四爷的府上吧
Is this the honourable home of Master Yuan?

1287
01:50:39,550 --> 01:50:41,090
有位叫程蝶衣的
When a man called Cheng Dieyi...

1288
01:50:42,010 --> 01:50:43,920
让人逮走的时候 说是
was arrested, he said...

1289
01:50:45,020 --> 01:50:46,870
这把剑的主人能救他
the owner of this sword would be able to rescue him.

1290
01:50:48,690 --> 01:50:49,570
您瞅瞅
Have a look,

1291
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:51,740
认得吗
Do you recognise it?

1292
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,400
瞧您这意思
From your expression,

1293
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:09,440
我是找对主儿了
I see I've come to the right place.

1294

那成
Good.

1295
01:51:13,080 --> 01:51:15,830
这剑呐 我给您搁这儿啦
I'll put the sword here.

1296
01:51:16,440 --> 01:51:17,080
啊
Oh.

1297
01:51:17,500 --> 01:51:21,120
这剑找着主儿 我也就放心了
I'm so relieved to have found its owner.

1298
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:30,250
可这人哪 也总有指望错的时候
But sometimes one's hopes are misplaced.

1299
01:51:31,380 --> 01:51:32,330
袁四爷
Master Yuan,

1300
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:35,310
您可别怪罪蝶衣呀
you mustn't blame Dieyi.

1301
01:51:40,240 --> 01:51:42,060
诶 弄明白啰
Hey, I see.

1302
01:51:44,040 --> 01:51:45,680
他给日本人唱堂会
He didn't say I...

1303
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:47,120
怕不是袁…
I put him up to it,

1304
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:50,040
袁某的指使吧
did he?

1305
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:51,100
哟
Oh,

1306
01:51:52,040 --> 01:51:54,180
要是您袁四爷 让他去的
If you were involved,

1307
01:51:54,790 --> 01:51:56,690
他能让人给逮起来吗
he wouldn't be in trouble, would he?

1308
01:51:58,160 --> 01:51:58,880
那是
True!

1309
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:05,200

一屋的记者 都在家里等着呢
There's a roomful of reporters waiting at home.

袁四爷让我来关照你
Master Yuan asked me to talk to you.

1315
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:27,660
赶明儿个上了法庭
Tomorrow in court,

1316
01:52:28,610 --> 01:52:31,710
你得说是日本人 拿枪逼着你 去唱的堂会
say the Japanese put a gun to your head.

1317
01:52:32,740 --> 01:52:34,880
在兵营里头 给你动了刑
Say they tortured you.

1318
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,880
旁的 袁四爷都替你安排妥当了
Master Yuan has made arrangements for everything else.

1319
01:52:49,210 --> 01:52:50,980
这是小楼让我交给你的
This is from Xiaolou.

1320
01:53:01,710 --> 01:53:03,750
蝶衣 你别怨我们
Dieyi, don't be angry with us.

1321
01:53:04,540 --> 01:53:05,770
小楼的孩子
The death of...

1322
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,070
死了
...Xiaolou's child...

1323
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:18,870
这就是你们在一块儿唱戏的报应
was karmic retribution for your partnership.

1324
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:30,260
出去以后
After you get out of here,

1325
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,000
你走你的阳关道 去吧
just go your own way.

1326
01:53:40,550 --> 01:53:46,380
查伶人程蝶衣 在我中华民国 对日抗战时期
During the War of Resistance against the Japanese,

1327
01:53:46,940 --> 01:53:51,480
竟与日寇驻平警备旅团之敌酋 青木三郎
the accused, Cheng Dieyi, performed pornographic works

1328
01:53:51,870 --> 01:53:55,420
互通款曲 狼狈为奸

1329
01:53:55,820 --> 01:54:00,440
以淫词艳曲 为日寇作堂会演出
Cheng and Aoki expressed mutual affection and acted in collusion,

1330
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:04,560
长敌之气焰 灭我之尊严
boosting enemy morale and damaging national self-respect.

1331
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:09,130
敌酋青木三郎 在日军投降后
After the Japanese surrender, Aoki refused to give up

1332
01:54:09,340 --> 01:54:12,600
仍有反抗举动 已被我军击毙
and was shot dead by our troops.

1333
01:54:13,230 --> 01:54:17,310
其与被告往来之罪证相片 已落入我方
His association with the accused is well documented in photographs. 

1334

The government has always been good to me.

1340
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,200
岂敢昧法
I wouldn't dare deceive the court.

1341
01:54:44,220 --> 01:54:47,360
更不敢 当众违背天理良心
Nor would I betray the laws of heaven nor my own conscience.

1342
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:54,500
程蝶衣 确实是被日本人 用手铐铐走的
Cheng Dieyi was taken away in handcuffs by the Japanese.

1343
01:54:55,980 --> 01:54:58,840
还用手枪顶其项背威胁
They put a gun to the back of his neck,

1344
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:01,940
就是后脖梗子
is the back stalk.

1345
01:55:04,620 --> 01:55:05,440
段小楼

1346
01:55:05,770 --> 01:55:06,540
啊 是 是
Uh, it's true.

1347
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:08,770
日本人
The Japanese...

1348
01:55:09,940 --> 01:55:11,160
他是打了我师弟
...beat up my stage brother.

1349
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:14,060
这四爷全说了
Exactly as Master Yuan has just described.

1350
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:14,930

他...人...
He...

1353

方才检查官声言
The procurator spoke...

1354
01:55:23,930 --> 01:55:27,120
程之所唱 为淫词艳曲
...of "pornographic" singing.

1355
01:55:31,610 --> 01:55:33,460
实为大谬
That's absurd.

1356
01:55:41,450 --> 01:55:43,560
程 当晚所唱
That evening, Cheng sang...

1357
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:46,700
是昆曲“牡丹亭·游园”一折
...excerpts from "Peony Pavilion" and "Wandering in a Garden".

1358
01:55:47,980 --> 01:55:50,660
略有国学常识者 都明白
Anyone with a smidgen of traditional learning knows...

1359
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:55,020
此折乃国剧文化中之最精粹
...they're opera classics.

1360
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:58,530
何以在检查官先生口中
How can you call...

1361
01:55:58,770 --> 01:56:01,450
竟成了淫词艳曲了呢
...them pornographic?

1362
01:56:05,180 --> 01:56:07,780
如此糟践戏剧国粹
Given such an insult to our culture,

1363
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:10,810
到底是谁...
we must ask who in fact...

1364
01:56:11,260 --> 01:56:13,690
专门辱我民族精神
is insulting our national spirit...

1365
01:56:16,720 --> 01:56:19,040
灭我国家尊严
...and dignity?

1366
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:22,440
好…
Bravo!

1367
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:28,000
被告人 程蝶衣
We ask the accused, Cheng Dieyi,

1368
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:32,000
证人所述 属实吗
have the witnesses told the truth?

1369
01:56:39,960 --> 01:56:40,820
被告人
The court...

1370
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:45,220
本庭 要求你对日本军部事件
...wishes to hear what the accused...

1371
01:56:45,760 --> 01:56:47,650
作自我陈述
...has to say.

1372
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:55,200
程蝶衣
Cheng Dieyi!

1373
01:56:59,340 --> 01:57:00,560
堂会我去了
I sang for the Japanese.

1374
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:05,080
我也恨日本人
I hate the Japanese too.

1375
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:09,810
可是他们...
But they...

1376
01:57:11,940 --> 01:57:12,780
没有打我
...didn't lay a hand on me.

1377
01:57:17,610 --> 01:57:19,400
被告人程蝶衣
Cheng Dieyi...

1378
01:57:20,730 --> 01:57:22,620
你有义务和权利
you have the right and duty...

1379
01:57:22,940 --> 01:57:26,440
用事实来证明 你清白的人格
...to clear your name.

1380
01:57:28,920 --> 01:57:32,260
你 再仔细回忆一下
Reconsider carefully...

1381
01:57:33,460 --> 01:57:35,100
再做一次陈述
...and tell us again what happened.

1382
01:57:38,380 --> 01:57:39,530
青木要是活着
If Aoki lived,

1383
01:57:41,570 --> 01:57:44,880
京戏 就传到日本国去了
he'd have taken Peking Opera to Japan.

1384
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:51,840
你们杀了我吧
Just kill me, why don't you?

1385
01:57:56,080 --> 01:57:56,880
四爷
Master Yuan,

1386
01:57:57,580 --> 01:57:58,300
四爷
Master Yuan,

1387
01:57:59,080 --> 01:57:59,810
四爷
Master Yuan,

1388

02:09:27,690 --> 02:09:28,780
- 给我 - 别闹了
- Give it to me. - No kidding,

1544
02:09:34,570 --> 02:09:35,640
放开我
let me go!

1545
02:09:47,810 --> 02:09:48,620
不要动
Don't move!

1546
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:54,170
怎么着
How is he?

1547
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:55,540
看样子 得用点药
I think we'll have to give him some drugs.

1548
02:09:56,090 --> 02:09:56,880
你看着点
Keep an eye on him.

1549
02:09:57,410 --> 02:09:58,230
别让他挣蹦出来
Don't let him hurt himself.

1550
02:09:58,330 --> 02:10:00,310
诶 小楼 你可别走啊
Don't go, Xiaolou.

1551
02:10:00,390 --> 02:10:02,520
无碍的 他要想把大烟戒了
If he really wants to overcome his addiction to opium,

1552
02:10:02,890 --> 02:10:04,680
还得脱几层皮呢 这才是个头
he's going to have to go through hell! This is just the start.

1553
02:10:04,860 --> 02:10:05,550
诶
Hey.

1554
02:10:45,170 --> 02:10:45,960
我冷
I'm cold!

1555
02:10:52,270 --> 02:10:53,000
娘
Ma!

1556
02:10:55,050 --> 02:10:56,820
水都冻冰了
The water's all turned to ice!

1557
02:11:00,720 --> 02:11:01,580
我冷
I'm cold!

1558
02:11:06,110 --> 02:11:06,970
娘
Ma!

1559
02:11:08,870 --> 02:11:10,560
水都冻冰了
The water's all turned to ice!

1560
02:11:14,140 --> 02:11:14,920
我冷
I'm cold...

1561
02:11:18,570 --> 02:11:19,590
好了 好了
It's OK. Everything's all right.

1562
02:11:28,360 --> 02:11:30,820
“解放军的天是晴明的天”
The sky of the liberated areas is clear and blue

1563
02:11:31,290 --> 02:11:33,370
“解放区的人民好喜欢”
The people of the liberated areas are happy...

1564
02:11:38,430 --> 02:11:39,230
段师母
Mrs Duan!

1565
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:42,820
你到哪儿去了
Where were you?

1566
02:11:43,800 --> 02:11:44,680
开会去了
A meeting.

1567
02:11:45,930 --> 02:11:46,670
开会去了
A meeting?

1568
02:11:46,750 --> 02:11:47,420
诶
Yes.

1569
02:11:54,910 --> 02:11:56,470
小楼 师兄师弟们都来了
Xiaolou, the whole troupe's come.

1570
02:11:56,470 --> 02:11:57,150
诶 快请进
Come on in. Quick!

1571
02:11:57,150 --> 02:11:58,080
进来 进来啊
Come in! Come in!

1572
02:12:03,170 --> 02:12:04,400
换行头了啊
Ah, a costume change!

1573
02:12:08,480 --> 02:12:10,140
诶 多谢大伙来看我
Thank you all for coming to see me.

1574
02:12:10,630 --> 02:12:12,220
没事了 我好了
I'm fine now.

1575
02:12:12,340 --> 02:12:13,480
说得轻巧
Sounds easy now.

1576
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:15,710
没见遭罪的时候呢
You didn't see him suffer!

1577
02:12:15,800 --> 02:12:17,140
蝶衣 起来吧
Dieyi,

1578
02:12:17,140 --> 02:12:17,740
起来吧
get out of bed.

1579
02:12:17,740 --> 02:12:20,620
全北京的大街小巷 都支愣着耳朵
All of Peking is waiting with bated breath

1580
02:12:20,780 --> 02:12:23,390
等着听霸王和虞姬出场呐
for the next appearance of the king and his Concubine!

1581
02:12:24,260 --> 02:12:27,540
什么叫“盛代元音”呐 这他妈就是
It'll be the goddamn golden hit of a golden era.

1582
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:36,890
大家让我说几句
You've asked me to say a few words.

1583
02:12:37,180 --> 02:12:39,520
那我就说几句 说不好
I'm not sure how to put it.

1584
02:12:41,950 --> 02:12:42,760
现代戏
I think these modern operas...

1585
02:12:44,610 --> 02:12:45,390
有意思
...are interesting,

1586
02:12:46,680 --> 02:12:48,080
可现代戏的服装
but the costumes...

1587
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:49,440
有点怪
...aren't very attractive.

1588
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:51,450
不如行头好看
The backdrops are also too realistic,

1589
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:53,770
布景也太实
nothing pleasures the eye.

1590
02:12:54,820 --> 02:12:56,890
京戏讲究的 是个情境
Yet Peking Opera puts great value on ambience.

1591
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:59,600
唱 念 做 打
Song, recital, movement and acrobatics...

1592
02:12:59,930 --> 02:13:01,310
都在这个情境里面
...are part of this ambience.

1593
02:13:03,770 --> 02:13:06,030
穿上这一身 往布景前头一站
But if you're wearing outfits like these and standing...

1594
02:13:07,570 --> 02:13:09,410
玩艺再好 也不对头了
...in front of those backdrops, it just doesn't work.

1595
02:13:10,830 --> 02:13:14,120
我就怕 这么弄 就不是京戏了
I fear that this will be the end of opera, as we know it.

1596
02:13:15,410 --> 02:13:16,330
你们说呢
What do all of you think?

1597
02:13:22,570 --> 02:13:23,620
怎么现代戏
Are you saying that modern operas...

1598
02:13:24,380 --> 02:13:25,780
就不是京戏了
...aren't Peking Opera?

1599
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:27,480
京戏是什么
What is Peking Opera after all?

1600
02:13:28,200 --> 02:13:29,210
就是八个字
You can put it succinctly.

1601
02:13:29,470 --> 02:13:30,600
无声不歌
No sound but is a song,

1602
02:13:31,080 --> 02:13:32,200
无动不舞
no movement but is a dance.

1603
02:13:33,140 --> 02:13:34,780
得好看 美
It must have beauty.

1604
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:36,460
比方说啊
For instance...

1605
02:13:36,820 --> 02:13:37,860
- 这个... - 师傅
- This... - Teacher,

1606
02:13:38,820 --> 02:13:40,030
我没听明白
I don't get it.

1607
02:13:42,930 --> 02:13:44,670
等你流上 三船五车的汗
Practise. When you've sweated enough to fill buckets,

1608
02:13:45,320 --> 02:13:46,160
就明白了
you'll get it.

1609
02:13:46,970 --> 02:13:48,330
我还是不明白
I still don't understand.

1610
02:13:48,330 --> 02:13:49,010
四儿
Xiao Si!

1611
02:13:50,350 --> 02:13:51,440
我就是不明白
I just don't get it.

1612
02:13:52,140 --> 02:13:54,210
为什么古时候的英雄美人上了台
When ancient heroes and beauties take the stage,

1613
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,230
就是京戏
why should it be Peking Opera?

1614
02:13:55,660 --> 02:13:58,360
现在劳动人民上了台 就不是京戏了
but not when the labouring masses do?

1615
02:13:59,260 --> 02:14:01,100
你这...说的是两码事
You're talking apples and pears.

1616
02:14:01,330 --> 02:14:02,520
- 放肆  - 你什么态度
- Upstart! - What's this attitude?

1617
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:07,150
段师傅
Teacher Duan,

1618
02:14:08,010 --> 02:14:08,790
您说说
I'd like to hear from you.

1619
02:14:08,990 --> 02:14:09,700
小楼
Xiaolou!

1620
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:19,170
外边要下雨了
It's raining.

1621
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:20,720
给你伞
I've brought your umbrella.

1622
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,060
接着
Catch!

1623
02:14:31,780 --> 02:14:32,420
得
Yes,

1624
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:33,600
知道了
yes,

1625
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:35,340
家去吧
run along home now.

1626
02:14:50,180 --> 02:14:52,900
一提这论理的事儿 我头就大
Discussions about ethics give me a headache.

1627
02:14:54,890 --> 02:14:55,760
依我看啊
I say...

1628
02:14:56,740 --> 02:14:58,620
只要是唱这西皮二黄
if it uses the traditional musical forms,

1629
02:14:59,460 --> 02:15:00,720
它就是京戏
then it's Peking Opera.

1630
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:03,020
是不是
Am I right?

1631
02:15:04,200 --> 02:15:04,820
小楼
Xiaolou.

1632
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:06,790
我...我发两句言 啊
I'd like to say something.

1633
02:15:10,600 --> 02:15:13,680
自打把这戏院 啊 交给咱们国家
I've been part of the New Society since giving...

1634
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:15,660
咱就都是新人了
...my theatre to the state.

1635
02:15:17,790 --> 02:15:19,190
程同志 也不对
Comrade Cheng, I believe you're wrong.

1636
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:24,430
这现代戏 它是个新事
Modern opera is a new venture,

1637
02:15:25,060 --> 02:15:28,180
咱们应当拥护啊 应当支持啊
it deserves our support.

1638
02:15:34,860 --> 02:15:36,540
功也不练 嗓也不吊
You never practise.

1639
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:38,430
耍贫顶嘴 你倒学成了
If opera relied on being a smartass, you'd graduate with honours.

1640
02:15:39,080 --> 02:15:40,340
唱戏的不靠这个
Opera requires practice,

1641
02:15:40,680 --> 02:15:43,250
凭的是功夫 本事 玩艺儿
skill and talent.

1642
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:45,450
没你的近道儿可走
There are no shortcuts!

1643
02:15:46,210 --> 02:15:47,020
罚我跪
By forcing me to kneel,

1644
02:15:47,790 --> 02:15:48,600
你犯法
you're breaking the law.

1645
02:15:49,780 --> 02:15:52,380
不罚 不罚你永远是下三滥
And if I don't punish you, you'll always be third-rate.

1646
02:15:52,820 --> 02:15:53,780
还想成角儿
You want to be a great actor?

1647
02:15:53,930 --> 02:15:54,700
做梦
Dream on!

1648
02:15:57,440 --> 02:16:01,560
没错 你领我来 哪儿是想让我成角儿
And when did you ever seriously want me to succeed?

1649
02:16:02,490 --> 02:16:04,010
你是想找个小力笨儿
All you've ever wanted is a coolie,

1650
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:05,750
小催帮儿
a stage hand...

1651
02:16:06,210 --> 02:16:08,520
小跟包 小腿子 小龙套
a follower, a dogsbody, a bit player!

1652
02:16:09,120 --> 02:16:10,860
你放肆 你大胆
How dare you!

1653
02:16:11,200 --> 02:16:12,400
我让你胡说八道
You're speaking absolute rubbish!

1654
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:14,010
胡说八道 胡说八道
You're speaking absolute rubbish!

1655
02:16:19,150 --> 02:16:20,180
还不给我跪下
Kneel down!

1656
02:16:23,010 --> 02:16:23,720
师傅
Master,

1657
02:16:26,680 --> 02:16:28,180
永没那日子啦
You won't live to see the day!

1658
02:16:38,160 --> 02:16:39,010
四儿
Xiao Si!

1659
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:52,640
滚吧
Piss off then!

1660
02:16:53,130 --> 02:16:54,890
一辈子跑你的龙套去吧
Be a bit player your whole life!

1661
02:17:01,050 --> 02:17:01,880
程老板
Mr Cheng...

1662
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:06,600
您这话要搁在旧社会说
I can hardly...

1663
02:17:08,040 --> 02:17:08,880
我信
...believe this...

1664
02:17:10,650 --> 02:17:14,840
在新社会说 我不信
It's like something out of the Old Society!

1665
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:18,300
我要是再跑龙套
If I continue to get bit parts,

1666
02:17:19,700 --> 02:17:21,250
对不起您的栽培
I'll be unworthy of your patronage!

1667
02:18:07,580 --> 02:18:08,420
这么说
So,

1668
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:10,900
你知道
you know?

1669
02:18:11,250 --> 02:18:11,980
啊
What?

1670
02:18:12,420 --> 02:18:13,640
啊 嘿嘿
Yes. Uh.

1671
02:18:13,820 --> 02:18:14,880
这 我这
Uh, I...

1672
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:16,840
诶 我也是刚刚才知道
Uh, I just learned myself...

1673
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:17,780
不对吧
That's not true,

1674
02:18:18,770 --> 02:18:19,690
段师傅
Teacher Duan.

1675
02:18:20,480 --> 02:18:23,470
昨儿开会 您可是在场的啊
You were there at the meeting last night.

1676
02:18:28,650 --> 02:18:30,840
你说的 你去通知 蝶衣换角儿嘛
But you said you'd notify Dieyi that you were replacing him.

1677
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:32,100
啊
Ah.

1678
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:33,700
可后来我觉着
I had second thoughts.

1679
02:18:34,270 --> 02:18:36,380
这话 您说最合适
I decided you should tell him.

1680
02:18:36,990 --> 02:18:38,300
您同意了嘛
Don't you agree?

1681
02:18:39,450 --> 02:18:41,310
这话您都不说
If you couldn't tell him,

1682
02:18:41,640 --> 02:18:43,260
还有谁能说呀
who could?

1683
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:48,220
掭了
Take it off!

1684
02:18:50,370 --> 02:18:51,060
掭了
Take it off!

1685
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:53,490
赶快唱啦 师哥 您别这样
Don't. Don't be like that!

1686
02:18:53,670 --> 02:18:54,450
师哥
Bro.

1687
02:18:54,450 --> 02:18:55,520
我他妈的不唱了
I won't fucking sing anymore!

1688
02:18:56,100 --> 02:18:57,280
谁爱唱 谁唱去
Let whoever wants to perform do so.

1689
02:18:57,390 --> 02:18:59,460
赶快唱啦 师哥 您别走
Don't. Don't be like that!

1690
02:18:59,850 --> 02:19:00,500
小楼
Xiaolou,

1691
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:01,800
小楼 你不能走
Xiaolou, you mustn't go.

1692
02:19:08,980 --> 02:19:10,310
段小楼同志
Comrade Duan,

1693
02:19:16,650 --> 02:19:19,550
而今台下坐的 可都是劳动人民
that audience is made up of the Iabou ring masses.

1694
02:19:20,690 --> 02:19:24,850
唱不唱 您自个儿掂量着
You decide for yourself whether or not to sing for them.

1695
02:19:40,520 --> 02:19:42,760
小楼 虞姬都上了
Xiaolou, the concubine's on stage.

1696
02:19:43,090 --> 02:19:44,270
你该盯场了
You'd better hurry.

1697
02:19:47,940 --> 02:19:48,680
小楼
Xiaolou...

1698
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,140
段老板
Mr Duan!

1699
