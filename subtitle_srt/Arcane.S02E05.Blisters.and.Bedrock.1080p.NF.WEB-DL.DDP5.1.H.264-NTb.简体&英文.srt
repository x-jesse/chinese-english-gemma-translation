你的话我一个字都不想听

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,700

是范德尔

范德尔 他还活着
He's... alive.

34
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,330
编瞎话你真是张口就来啊
We both know that's bullshit.

35
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,290
他需要我们的帮助
He needs our help.

36
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,660
你信我一次
I can prove it.

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,790
? I wake up to the sounds Of the silence that allows ?

38
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:09,330
? For my mind to run around With my ear up to the ground ?

39
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,000
? I'm searching to behold The stories that are told ?

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,580
? When my back is to the world That was smiling when I turned ?

41
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,080
? Tell you you're the greatest ?

42
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:28,040
? But once you turn, they hate us ?

43
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,040
? Oh, the misery ?

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,250
? Everybody wants to be my enemy ?

45
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,700
? Oh, spare the sympathy ?

46
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,620
? Everybody wants to be my enemy ?

47
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,950
? Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way ?

48
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,750
? My enemy ?

49
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,370
? Pray it away, I swear I'll never be a saint ?

50
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,660
? Look out for yourself ?

51
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,660
《英雄联盟:双城之战》
第二季第五集

52
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,660
本WEB版外挂字幕由  风吹来的那片云  双语合并

53
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,950
和平接管维持了这么多个月
Months of peacekeeping occupation.

54
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,660
进行了那么多次清剿
Countless operations.

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,950
付出了那么多的心血和代价
Oceans of sweat and tears.

56
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:08,040
还以为跟底城这段恩怨 可以画上句号了
I'd begun to think we might finally see an end to Zaun's perverse abominations.

57
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,790
我可真是蠢到家了
How foolish was I?

58
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,700
那怪物是冲你来的
The beast came for you.

59
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,660
是你把它召唤来的
It was summoned by you.

60
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,750
以我的经验看
In my experience,

61
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:25,700
面对指控 有罪的人往往选择沉默
only guilty men answer accusations with silence.

62
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,660
以我的经验看
In my experience,

63
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,750
有权的人多少都有罪
no one in power is innocent.

64
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,040
这座监狱底下还有一些牢房
There are cells buried deep within this prison

65
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,200
那里伸手不见五指 连呼吸都成问题
so devoid of light and fresh air

66
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,700
更别谈什么基本的生存保障
and all basic human considerations that up till now,

67
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,540
本来已经被我禁用了
I have forbidden their use.

68
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:43,700
不想让自己后半辈子 在那种地方过活的话
If you do not want to waste away the remainder of your days in one of these,

69
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,120
你的选择只有一个
you have one recourse.

70
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,290
说吧 该怎么追捕那头怪物
Tell us everything we need to know

71
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,540
说仔细点儿
to hunt down this beast.

72
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,910
你把心急写在了脸上
Your youth betrays you.

73
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,950
耐心是被岁月磨出来的
Patience is a product of age.

74
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,870
你看 我就是个活生生的例子
Both of which I possess in abundance.

75
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,120
这一次是你最后的机会
This is your final chance.

76
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,370
快说你在谋划什么
Tell me what you were planning.

77
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,870
还有 金克丝都干了什么
How was Jinx involved?

78
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:28,410
那你就等着烂在这儿吧
You will rot in here.

79
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,830
依罗拉
Elora?

80
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,540
黑色玫瑰
Black Rose.

81
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:09,080
不知道这个地方你待得习不习惯
Hope you find these quarters to your liking.

82
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,370
我总想换个地方
They still haven't replied

83
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,950
可他们却一直不答应
to my requests for a transfer.

84
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,540
是谁在那儿
Who's there?

85
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,200
我就快忘了自己是谁了
Not sure I know anymore.

86
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,700
把咱们请到这儿的人
Our hosts have a way

87
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,580
总有办法把你脑子搅乱
of scrambling your omelet.

88
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,700
他们害死了我的朋友
They killed my friend.

89
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:32,410
当时依罗拉就在那儿 然后就...
Elora was there. And then...

90
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,660
依罗拉
Elora!

91
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,790
旧世界的掌管者
Ah. The stewards of the old world

92
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:44,160
一有机会就喜欢 小小地炫耀一下他们的能耐
are always keen to give you a glimpse of their might.

93
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,700
这是什么地方
What is this place?

94
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,830
据我所知
Near as I can tell,

95
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,830
叫窥视之地
an Oculorum.

96
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,370
有传说记载 这个地方
According to legend,

97
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,790
起初是人们为了 禁锢伪先知专门建造的
the ancients built specialized chambers to seal away false prophets.

98
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,370
要我说
But if you ask me,

99
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,120
这就是孔雀王子们 为了捉弄人们设下的虚幻牢笼
they're just the fancy pits peacock princes like to toss their friends into.

100
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,750
什么孔雀王子
Peacock princes?

101
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,580
抱歉 我们家开玩笑的说法
Sorry, just an old family joke.

102
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,700
是指那些有艺术天赋的统治者
You know, the kind of rulers with an artistic flair.

103
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,870
站到亮处来
Step into the light.

104
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,080
基诺
Kino?

105
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,950
是我啊 哥哥
It's me, brother.

106
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,450
梅尔
Mel.

107
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,580
梅尔
Mel.

108
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,750
你都这么大了
You've grown up.

109
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,290
他们到底还是找上你了
I'd hoped they'd never come for you.

110
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
我就是在这儿把他跟丢的
This is where I lost him.

111
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,870
好看吧 而且还没有毒
Cool, huh? Not even toxic.

112
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,290
应该没有
Pretty sure.

113
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,750
范德尔为什么要 一路往这么个地方跑
Why would Vander be all the way down here?

114
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,370
我哪知道 你自己去问他呀
Beats me. Ask him yourself.

115
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,790
你什么时候能承认 这只是你的妄想而已
When will you admit that this is just one of your fantasies?

116
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,830
你爱妄想这事儿应该 不想让这孩子知道吧
Or do you not want the kid to know how delusional you are?

117
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,620
她以前可不是这样的
She wasn't always like this.

118
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,120
以前的她比现在好多了
She actually used to be pretty cool,

119
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,500
都赖我 老是对她动手
before I kicked her butt.

120
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,870
我说什么来着 又妄想了
See what I mean? Delusional.

121
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,250
你跑去跟杀了 老爸老妈的皮城走狗混在一起
Wish I was just seeing things when you decided

122
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,750
这事最好也是我妄想出来的
to throw in with the Piltie goons who murdered Mom and Dad.

123
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:06,200
起码他们不用亲眼看到 自己的女儿成了个疯子
At least they never had to see the psycho their daughter turned into.

124
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,250
哪个女儿啊
Which one?

125
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,950
该醒醒的是你 我可是英雄
Wake up, sis. I'm a hero.

126
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,120
我从静水监狱救出了半个底城的人
I busted half of Zaun out of Stillwater

127
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,910
而你呢 成天醉得跟烂泥一样
while you were passed out in the bottom of a mug.

128
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,370
所以赶紧走吧 别逼我再打废你一次
Now can it and keep walking, before I kick your ass again.

129
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,200
要是离了你攒的那些破烂玩意
You wouldn't last one second

130
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,580
和下三滥的小阴招
without all your ugly gadgets

131
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,450
估计你连一秒都撑不住
and chickenshit tricks.

132
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,410
你不也是靠那花里胡哨的手套嘛
Ha! What about those overdesigned bitch-mittens

133
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,160
而且还不是你自己造的
you didn't even build yourself?

134
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,660
你刚才说谁是靠...
You think I need these to--?

135
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,370
看吧 帅不过一秒
There. One second.

136
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,950
要认输就趁现在
Last chance to surrender.

137
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:55,120
来啊 动手啊 大胖手
Go right ahead, fat hands.

138
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,080
嘿 小鬼
Hey, kid.

139
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,250
你没伤到哪儿吧
Still got all your insides?

140
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,000
可别丢下我们
But don't ditch us.

141
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,120
你来找我干什么
Why'd you come get me?

142
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,250
你根本不需要我的帮助
You don't actually need my help.

143
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,790
你早就不需要了
You haven't for a long time.

144
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,080
上次范德尔需要我们
Last time Vander needed us,

145
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,790
我们俩各干各的 结果...
we tried it alone, and

146
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,200
没成想
nothing

147
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,370
闯下了大祸
was ever the same.

148
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:09,120
这次
So...

149
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,080
或许我们可以重新来过
maybe this is like a do-over.

150
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,790
再说了
Besides,

151
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,830
他不也是你爸吗
he's your father too.

152
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,620
一直等着你呢
I've been expecting you.

153
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,950
你倒是沉得住气
Confident, aren't you?

154
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,870
渴望得到武器的人都有同一种眼神
It's always the same look when one covets a weapon.

155
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:49,790
我从血崖一路征战 杀到达尔莫平原
I've fought battles from the Bloodcliffs to the Dalamor Plain.

156
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:52,750
从来都没见过这么残暴的怪物
I've never seen a beast of such savagery.

157
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,160
论残暴 怪物可比不上人类
No beast is more savage than man.

158
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,620
直接说你的条件吧
I trust you have terms.

159
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,790
你要效忠于我
You will serve me.

160
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,450
我的敌人就是你的敌人
My enemies will be yours.

161
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,910
你的武器就是我的
Your weapons will be mine.

162
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,620
作为回报
In return,

163
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,700
你要什么我都可以满足
I will supply all your needs.

164
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,540
甚至尊你为德高望重的智囊
You will be treated as an esteemed adviser.

165
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,000
但一切的前提是你的忠心
But I demand absolute loyalty.

166
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,290
奉劝你不要妄为
Do not test this,

167
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:32,160
不然你会后悔没选凯特琳的地牢
or you will yearn for Caitlyn's dungeons.

168
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,370
你心里明白我想要什么
You already know what I want.

169
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,870
他不是什么怪物
He isn't a monster.

170
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,660
他曾经也是一个备受尊重的人
He was once a man. Well respected, at that.

171
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,870
只可惜卷进了一场大难
Victim of great tragedy.

172
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:56,910
他的求生意志非常顽强
He had a ferocious will to live.

173
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,750
忍受痛苦的能力也相当惊人
An incredible tolerance for pain.

174
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:04,500
是他让我取得了在其他实验对象身上
With him, I was able to make strides impossible with

175
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,120
实现不了的突破
any other specimen.

176
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,790
但心智
But the mind...

177
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,790
心智是我无法修复的
The mind I could not recover.

178
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:18,580
他的人性终究还是被兽性吞噬
The man forever lost in the bowels of the beast,

179
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,450
最终沦为嗜血的野兽
compelled only by the scent of blood.

180
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,000
我本来是这么认为的
Or so I thought.

181
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,120
现在看来呀 我是没有找到合适的催化剂
It now seems I had yet to uncover the right catalyst.

182
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,830
河床与水泡
Blisters and bedrock.

183
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,750
诺克萨斯为你举办了一场葬礼
There was a funeral for you in Noxus.

184
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:10,290
母亲没为我也立个雕像
Oh. Did Mother commission a statue?

185
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,950
我在皮城也祭奠你了
I held rites in Piltover.

186
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,200
她以为你已经死了
She believes you're dead.

187
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,950
我还真是总能让她失望
I do like to disappoint her.

188
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,540
你是怎么知道要这么做的
How did you know to do that?

189
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,370
不知道
I don't know.

190
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,620
只是凭感觉
I just felt...

191
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,290
这有点像某种谜题
It's like some sort of puzzle.

192
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,790
基诺 你究竟经历了什么
Kino, what happened to you?

193
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,330
你是怎么来到这里的
How did you wind up here?

194
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,160
她没有告诉你吗
She didn't tell you.

195
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,410
我在贝西利科认识 几个自称贵族的家伙
After a few rounds with some dubious noblefolk

196
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:02,870
一块儿喝了几杯
in Basilich,

197
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,660
听到了一些有关母亲的奇怪谣言
I started hearing strange rumors about Mother.

198
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:07,870
不是以前听的那些
Different than the usual kind.

199
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,000
他们说 许多年以前
They said, many years ago,

200
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,330
母亲去过他们那儿 还跟一个人
she passed through their hometown and...

201
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
有了感情
fell in love.

202
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,290
这可不像她会干的
That's not our mother.

203
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,540
谁说不是呢
Indeed.

204
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,200
可随着我的不断探访
But the more I inquired,

205
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,410
我觉得这个谣言更像是真的
the more I started believing it.

206
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,950
从当年的旅行日志
The old travel logs.

207
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,370
再到当地的记载
The local accounts.

208
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:32,040
我其实不该管的
I should have left it alone, but...

209
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,250
可是她跟那个男人有了孩子
The affair led to a child.

210
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,910
这怎么可能呢
That's impossible.

211
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,330
所以我们才会被带到这里
It is the reason we are here.

212
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,290
总之就是
Simply put,

213
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,450
那孩子身上一定有什么东西
whatever that child inherited is of terrible interest

214
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,450
让关我们的人很感兴趣
to our captors.

215
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,580
凭这个就能找到那头怪物了吗
This will allow you to locate your beast?

216
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,330
你也不能这么说
Not precisely.

217
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,540
我们家族保存的档案
My family archives have shed light

218
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,830
为这座城市解开过无数的谜团
on many of this city's mysteries.

219
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,870
指挥官
Commander.

220
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,000
将军
General.

221
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:35,410
当中有一个谜团特别有意思
One such mystery caught my attention.

222
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,330
德高望重的学院炼金术士 被离奇地解雇
The curious dismissal of a revered academy alchemist.

223
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,330
档案里只写了他才华出众
Unparalleled, by all accounts.

224
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:47,750
可是却没有提他犯了什么罪
And no mention of his crime.

225
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,540
这不禁让我想起了另外一个
This led to one other missing puzzle piece

226
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:03,160
让我困惑了很久的未解之谜
whose absence has always gnawed at my mind.

227
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,910
微光是谁发明的
Who invented Shimmer?

228
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,290
现在终于有答案了 对吧
We have our answer now, don't we,

229
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,870
李维克博士
Dr. Reveck?

230
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,500
你简直丧心病狂
You're a monster.

231
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,290
为什么
Why?

232
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:24,450
为什么要制造这些
Why do all this?

233
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,660
能让一个人甘愿当一个 被全天下唾弃的罪人的
Why does anyone commit acts others deem unspeakable?

234
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,580
只有爱
For love.

235
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,580
或许如果她还活着
Perhaps, in another life...

236
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,000
你们能成为朋友
you would have been friends.

237
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,040
我所做的一切
Everything I've done is

238
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,700
都是为了治好她
to cure her.

239
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,410
那头野兽应该是取得成功的关键
I believe the beast may hold the final key.

240
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,410
她到底得了什么病 需要你来治疗
Precisely what are you trying to cure?

241
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,870
我们每个人都会遭遇的痛苦
That affliction we all suffer.

242
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,750
死亡
Death.

243
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:57,580
我想创造一个不用再恐惧死亡的世界
Imagine a world that no longer need fear it.

244
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,040
- 梅尔  - 得想个办法出去
- Mel? - I'm getting us out of here.

245
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:28,120
假如这个地方是那种机关重重的迷宫
Say this is some sort of sordid labyrinth.

246
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,080
要是破解的时候弄错了
Usually there are consequences

247
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,160
通常都会受到一些惩罚
for someone who fails these tests.

248
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,750
甚至是致命的惩罚
Deadly consequences.

249
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,290
我有权知道真相
I deserve to know the truth.

250
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,950
当然了
Of course.

251
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,160
你也很好奇 为什么他们要瞒着你 对吧
Makes you wonder why she kept this from you, doesn't it?

252
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,910
这么多年都没有提过
For all these years?

253
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,660
感觉还有问题
I'm missing something.

254
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,870
要我说 问题就是你太没有戒心了
A healthy sense of self-preservation, I'd say.

255
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,330
你不是我哥哥
You aren't my brother.

256
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,580
你是谁 你把基诺怎么了
Who are you? What have you done with Kino?

257
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,870
我们对他的期望有些过高了
We had such high hopes for him.

258
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,870
一开始我们都以为
At first, it seemed plausible

259
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:46,250
他应该就是那个孩子
that he could have been the child.

260
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,080
可你母亲的种种举动
But then your mother...

261
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,080
让我们发现原来你才是 姐妹
led us to you. Sister.

262
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,330
那是什么
What is it?

263
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,700
范德尔留下的字条
A message from Vander.

264
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,080
给希尔科的
To Silco.

265
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,450
希尔科 我到处在找你
"Silco, I've looked everywhere, but..."

266
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,830
可你好像铁了心要躲我
I've looked everywhere, but... it's clear you don't wanna be found.

267
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,660
该怎么说呀
God, I'm shit at this.

268
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,330
对不起
I'm sorry.

269
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,450
她死的那一刻 我失去了理智
When she died, I lost my head.

270
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,000
我跟自己说
I told myself

271
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,330
我对你做的一切都是为了大义
what I did to you was for the greater good,

272
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,750
你罪有应得
that you deserved it.

273
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,540
可是到头来 我也并不无辜
But the dirt was on both our hands.

274
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,950
你知道去哪能找到我
Anyway, you know where to find me.

275
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,870
河床与水泡
Blisters and bedrock.

276
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,120
范德尔
V.

277
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,290
当初他要是看到了
If he found this,

278
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,450
一切可能都会不一样
everything might have been different.

279
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,410
得赶紧离开这儿
We have to get out of here.

280
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,000
是他 是范德尔
It's him. It's Vander.

281
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,370
那个不是范德尔
That's not Vander.

282
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,950
就是他 他应该是被什么东西刺激到了
It is. Something's got him riled up.

283
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:44,250
不要 范德尔 不要
No, Vander, no.

284
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,410
是我
It's me.

285
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,080
他会杀了我们的
He's gonna kill you.

286
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,290
别伤害他
Don't hurt him.

287
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,250
别
Hark!

288
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:01,040
蔚 就是他
Vi, it's him.

289
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,660
你就信我这一次
You have to believe me.

290
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,660
范德尔
Vander!

291
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,250
今天什么日子啊
What's the occasion?

292
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,160
就是美女想听老歌了 不行吗
Can't a lady just be in the mood for a familiar song?

293
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,330
美女不太对劲
Not this lady,

294
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,750
歌也不怎么搭
and not this song.

295
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,540
今晚
Tonight

296
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:06,450
两个不靠谱的笨蛋 一拍脑门想出的大计划
a harebrained scheme these two bozos cooked up

297
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,290
终于如愿以偿
to turn a dank crack

298
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,620
把一条不起眼的裂沟变成了一个
in the earth into a thriving, healthy community

299
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:12,540
繁荣的家园
became a reality.

300
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,500
今晚 是吗
Tonight, eh?

301
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,700
说你呢 笨蛋二号
You hear that, Bozo 2?

302
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,870
梦想成真了 我们做到了
We made it. We're done.

303
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,160
恐怕你搞错了吧
Oh, you're sadly mistaken.

304
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,450
我是笨蛋一号
I'm Bozo 1.

305
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,540
为了今晚 走一个
A night of revelations.

306
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:31,370
我有了
I'm knocked up.

307
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,040
是个女孩
A girl.

308
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
你怎么知道
How do you know?

309
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,330
其实算是一个意外吧
Wasn't really part of my plan,

310
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,620
不过兜里没钱的时候
but guess that's everything

311
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,830
出点什么事都是意外
when you're living week to week.

312
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,450
那康诺怎么想
What did Connol say?

313
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,040
没告诉他呢
I haven't told him.

314
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,120
还没想好怎么说
Working up the nerve.

315
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:03,830
养孩子我一窍不通
I don't know anything about kids.

316
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,290
光是跟孩子单独相处 我都犯怵
I get sweaty being alone with one.

317
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,410
嘿 你会成为一个很棒的母亲
Hey, you're gonna be a great mother.

318
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:11,910
快得了吧 我没准备好呢
Shut up. I'm not ready for that.

319
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:14,870
我正琢磨着给孩子起一个什么名字
I started trying to come up with a name,

320
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,830
然后我突然意识到一旦
and it hits me that this one word

321
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,660
决定了
is a decision

322
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,040
将来她就要带着这个名字过一辈子
she's gonna live with her whole life.

323
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:27,250
我没办法一边在这么个破地方 为她遮风挡雨
I can't protect her from all the shit down here

324
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,000
一边还要努力当一个合格的妈妈
and work out how to be a parent at the same time.

325
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:34,040
可是我转念一想
Then I realized,

326
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,450
我也没什么可怕的
I don't have to.

327
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:37,250
怎么说
Why's that?

328
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:39,080
这事既然你们俩已经知道了
Because the second I told you,

329
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,580
就别想置身事外
I put you on the hook.

330
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,660
你们俩必须为底城谋一条出路
You two are gonna figure this Zaun thing out.

331
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,830
哪怕这条出路是靠 挖河床挖得满手水泡换来的
I don't care if you have to carve it out of the bedrock, covered in blisters.

332
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,330
反正你俩不许失败
You're not allowed to fail anymore.

333
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:51,870
为了她
For her.

334
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,910
为了我
For me.

335
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,580
连一两个小屁孩也养不好
What's the point if we can't raise an ankle biter

336
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,830
那咱们也别混了
or two?

337
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,580
为了底城
To Zaun, then.

338
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,160
河床与水泡
Blisters and bedrock.

339
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,330
河床与水泡
Blisters and bedrock.

340
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,160
我觉得蔚奥莱这个名字很不错
I've always liked the name Violet.

341
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:27,120
? First you'll wake up in a cold sweat ?

342
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:35,540
? Come closer, will you, babe? ?

343
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,120
? All this hatred in your heart again ?

344
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:51,120
? I'm the one who hopes For all these things that I miss ?

345
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,250
? Told me feelings like this again ?

346
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:07,120
? Though I'm bitter, I can't pretend ?

347
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:15,370
? This story is over I predict the end... ?

348
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,580
你磨蹭什么呢
What are you waiting for?

349
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,000
他也是你爸
He's your dad too.

350
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,120
? What have you done to us? ?

351
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,750
? What have you done to us? ?

352
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,870
? What have you done to us? ?

353
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,700
萨罗
Salo?

354
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,750
你在这儿干什么
What are you doing here?

355
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:12,870
杰斯
Jayce.

356
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,040
这问题正好我也想问你
One could ask the same question.

357
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:21,660
你怎么又能走了
How are you walking?

358
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,450
你不想知道是谁这么妙手回春吗
Who do you think could mend such a broken creature?

359
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,950
你想不想同他说几句
Would you want to speak with him?

360
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:36,410
杰斯
Jayce.

361
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:40,370
我还担心再也没有机会和你说话了呢
I'd feared I wouldn't have the chance to speak with you again.

362
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,160
维克托
Viktor?

363
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:47,450
其实我更愿意跟你当面交流
I would prefer to converse in person.

364
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,660
但我还有很多事情要做
But there's so much work to be done.

365
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:54,080
你是怎么做到的
How are you doing this?

366
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,540
我们上次对话之后
I suppose this is somewhat beyond

367
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,080
确实发生了很多事情
where we left off.

368
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,830
那萨罗他还在吗
Is Salo still in there?

369
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,370
不然我还能去哪儿
Where else would I be?

370
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:09,540
放心吧 你们的谈话内容我绝对保密
You have my solemn vow that anything you discuss

371
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,450
一个字都不会说出去
will be kept in the strictest confidence.

372
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:14,500
我欠维克托的太多了
I owe Viktor... everything.

373
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:18,120
谢谢你的好意 萨罗
Very kind, Salo.

374
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
我取得了不少突破
I have so many breakthroughs

375
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,250
正想和你分享呢 杰斯
to share with you, Jayce.

376
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,370
我以为你放弃海克斯科技了
I thought you were done with Hextech.

377
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,330
放弃我了
And me.

378
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,660
是我被情绪蒙蔽了双眼
I was clouded by emotions.

379
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,660
来吧 到我这儿来
Come. Visit me.

380
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,370
来看看我取得的成就
See what I've accomplished.

381
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,750
我帮助了很多人
I've helped so many.

382
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,540
你给普通人用了海克斯科技
You've given Hextech to the people?

383
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,870
就像你我曾经许诺的那样
As we always promised we would.

384
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,790
维克托真的创造出了奇迹
Viktor has truly worked wonders.

385
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,750
海克斯科技不是奇迹
Hextech isn't a miracle.

386
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,040
它是诅咒
It's a curse.

387
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,000
我们必须终结它 维克托
We have to end it, Viktor.

388
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:14,200
别无选择
We have to.

389
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,660
你好像变了
You seem different.

390
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,580
发生了什么事
Something happened.

391
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,450
我明白了
Now I see it.

392
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,250
应该是你也接触过奥术了
You, too, have touched the Arcane.

393
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,370
心智受了影响
Your mind suffered.

394
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,660
恕我先告辞了
If you'll excuse me,

395
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:45,000
我必须回到他那儿去了
I must return to him.

396
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,660
我不能让你走
I can't let you leave.

397
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,450
那就只能说声抱歉了
I'm sorry you feel that way.

398
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,660
该我说才对
I'm sorry too.

399
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,950
